### Prompt 1 (9:52 AM)
```
please create a new issue, branch, and pr (use the gh command) for updating the roo rules, then let's examine how we can fix the '.roo/rules/02-prompt-history-and-reflection.md' (see below for file content) - despite explicit instruction the agents are not creating the required files on each session/turn... I suggest inserting language like "This document defines MANDATORY requirements for all modes when using the attempt_completion tool. These requirements ensure proper feedback tracking, natural language communication, and task completion signaling.  Each mode is responsible for directly creating and updating the prompt-history and reflection files."
```
