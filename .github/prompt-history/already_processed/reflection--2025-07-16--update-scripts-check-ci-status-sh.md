## Task Summary
Updated `scripts/check_ci_status.sh` to always print a countdown between polling intervals, while only printing the status line when it changes. Retained summary and collapsed status logic, and clarified the script with comments.

## Implementation Details
- Modified the polling loop to print a countdown ("Waiting 10s... 9s... ...") after each poll, regardless of status change.
- Ensured the status line is only printed when it changes, not on every interval.
- Retained the logic for collapsing repeated status lines and for summary output at the end.
- Added clarifying comments to the script.
- Committed as `4fcd4b2` with message: "ci: add countdown and always print status in check_ci_status.sh".
- Pushed to the current branch.
- Ran the script and confirmed the new behavior in terminal output.

## Feedback Summary
**User Interactions Observed:**
- User clarified that the status should NOT be printed again if unchanged, only the countdown should be shown.
- No further corrections or requests for different approaches.

**Workflow Observations:**
- Task Complexity: 5 (multi-step, but straightforward shell scripting and git workflow)
- Iterations Required: 2 (one revision after user feedback)
- Time Investment: ~20 minutes
- Mode Switches: None

**Learning Opportunities:**
- User feedback clarified the intended UX for status/collapsed output.
- Countdown logic is best added after the status logic, not as part of the status print.
- Pattern: Always confirm with user if output frequency/verbosity is ambiguous.

**Recommendations for Improvement:**
- Consider adding a test harness or dry-run mode for scripts like this to validate output patterns.
- Roo rules could clarify expectations for "always print" vs. "print on change" in polling UIs.
- Tooling could support capturing and diffing script output for easier confirmation.

## Next Steps
No further action required. The script now matches the requested behavior and is committed and pushed.
