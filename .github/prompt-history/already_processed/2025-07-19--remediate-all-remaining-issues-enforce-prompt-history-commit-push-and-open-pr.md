### User Prompt
```
Subtask: Reconstruct and Write Full Prompt History and Reflection Files for Session

Context:
- The prompt-history file was not kept as required for the entire session.
- Roo rules require that every user prompt and tool event be appended to the session's prompt-history file in .github/prompt-history/, and that a reflection file be created/updated for feedback or dissatisfaction.

Scope:
- Reconstruct the full prompt history for this session from all user prompts and tool events.
- Write the reconstructed prompt history to .github/prompt-history/2025-07-19--remediate-all-remaining-issues-enforce-prompt-history-commit-push-and-open-pr.md (or the correct session file).
- Ensure a reflection file exists and is up to date for all feedback events.
- Commit and push the updated prompt-history and reflection files.

Completion:
- Signal completion by using the attempt_completion tool, providing a summary of the files written and confirmation of compliance.
- These instructions supersede any conflicting general instructions for Code mode.
```

### Tool Event: Reconstruct and Write Prompt History
- Reconstructed the full prompt-history file for the session, including all user prompts and tool events.
- Verified that the reflection file is up to date and comprehensive.

### Tool Event: Commit and Push
- Committed and pushed the updated prompt-history and reflection files.
