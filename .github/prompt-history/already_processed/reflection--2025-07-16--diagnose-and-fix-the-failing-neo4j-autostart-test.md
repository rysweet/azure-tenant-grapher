## Task Summary
Diagnosed the root cause of the failing Neo4j autostart test. The test itself passes and the Neo4j container autostarts and is healthy, but the test run fails due to 0% code coverage being reported.

## Implementation Details
- Re-ran the test with verbose output and captured logs.
- Analyzed the error message, stack trace, and logs.
- Confirmed the Neo4j container starts, is healthy, and the correct port and timing logic are used.
- Reviewed the test and Docker logic for recent changes or breakage.
- Determined the failure is due to coverage not tracking subprocess execution, not a problem with the test or Neo4j.

## Feedback Summary
**User Interactions Observed:**
- No corrections or clarifications required.
- No user frustration or alternate requests observed.

**Workflow Observations:**
- Task Complexity: 6 (multi-step, but straightforward diagnosis)
- Iterations Required: 1
- Time Investment: ~10 minutes
- Mode Switches: None

**Learning Opportunities:**
- The test and container logic are robust and well-documented.
- Coverage configuration for subprocesses is a common pitfall in CLI/integration testing.
- The workflow for stepwise diagnosis and todo tracking is effective.

**Recommendations for Improvement:**
- Add a section to the test or developer docs about coverage and subprocesses.
- Consider a pre-commit or CI check for coverage subprocess configuration in CLI/integration tests.
- Tooling could auto-detect subprocess coverage gaps and suggest fixes.

## Next Steps
- Update coverage configuration to track subprocesses (set `COVERAGE_PROCESS_START`, use `.coveragerc` with `[run] parallel=True`, and ensure the CLI is invoked with coverage).
- Optionally, add a developer note to the test file or README.
