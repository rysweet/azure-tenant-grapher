## Task Summary
Edited the integration test [`tests/cli/test_build_autostart.py`](tests/cli/test_build_autostart.py) to add `--resource-limit=1`, set timeout to 120s, and document the flag, per instructions to avoid long-running builds and test timeouts.

## Implementation Details
- Appended `--resource-limit=1` to the CLI invocation in the test.
- Set the subprocess timeout to 120 seconds.
- Added a comment explaining the need for the flag.
- Did not modify production code or other tests, as required.
- Ran the targeted test; it still hangs, even with the resource limit and increased timeout.
- User feedback confirms suspicion of a deeper issue in the resource processing logic.

## Feedback Summary
**User Interactions Observed:**
- User confirmed the test still hangs and suspects a bug in resource processing logic.
- No requests for further changes to the test itself.

**Workflow Observations:**
- Task Complexity: 4 (simple edit, but blocked by external logic)
- Iterations Required: 2 (initial edit, then timeout adjustment)
- Time Investment: ~10 minutes
- Mode Switches: None

**Learning Opportunities:**
- Test edits alone cannot resolve underlying CLI or resource processing bugs.
- Timeout and resource limit flags are not always sufficient for deterministic test completion if the CLI logic is faulty.
- Prompt, clear reporting of blocked status is essential.

**Recommendations for Improvement:**
- Consider adding a diagnostic mode or dry-run to the CLI for future testability.
- Add a troubleshooting section to the test or documentation for when resource limiting does not resolve timeouts.
- Encourage early detection of logic bugs by running integration tests after any CLI resource handling changes.

## Next Steps
- Escalate or file an issue for the suspected resource processing bug in the CLI.
- Unblock test only after the underlying logic is fixed.
- No further test changes recommended until CLI bug is addressed.
