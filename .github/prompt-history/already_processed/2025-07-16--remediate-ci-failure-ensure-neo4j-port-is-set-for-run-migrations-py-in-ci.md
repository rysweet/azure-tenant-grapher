### User Prompt
Remediate CI failure: ensure NEO4J_PORT is set for run_migrations.py in CI.

Scope:
1. Update the CI workflow YAML (e.g., `.github/workflows/ci.yml` or equivalent) to ensure NEO4J_PORT is set in the environment before any step that runs `scripts/run_migrations.py` or any Python entrypoint that requires it.
   - Add `export NEO4J_PORT=7687` (or the correct value) before the migration step.
   - If using a matrix or multiple jobs, ensure the variable is set in all relevant jobs/steps.
2. Optionally, add a comment referencing `.env.example` and the requirement for NEO4J_PORT.
3. Commit with message: "ci: set NEO4J_PORT for migration and CLI steps"
4. Push and monitor CI for resolution.
5. Report via `attempt_completion`:
   - Confirm the workflow change and commit SHA.
   - State if CI passes or if further issues remain.

Do not make any unrelated code or config changes in this step.
