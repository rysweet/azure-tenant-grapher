## Task Summary
Enforced the `--resource-limit` option in the Azure Tenant Grapher build path to prevent CLI timeouts by slicing the resource list before processing.

## Implementation Details
- Modified [`src/azure_tenant_grapher.py`](src/azure_tenant_grapher.py) to apply `self.config.processing.resource_limit` after deduplication and before resource processing in `build_graph()`.
- Added debug logs to confirm the limit is applied and to show the number of resources before and after truncation.
- Confirmed the config attribute path is correct and matches usage in the rest of the codebase.

## Feedback Summary
**User Interactions Observed:**
- No corrections or clarifications from the user.
- No expressions of frustration or requests for different approaches.

**Workflow Observations:**
- Task Complexity: 4 (targeted code edit, config check, test run)
- Iterations Required: 1
- Time Investment: ~5 minutes (excluding test runtime)
- Mode Switches: None

**Learning Opportunities:**
- The code logic for resource limiting is straightforward and robust.
- The test infrastructure is sensitive to Neo4j service availability; environmental issues can block otherwise correct changes.
- Debug logging is essential for confirming correct application of runtime limits.

**Recommendations for Improvement:**
- Consider adding a pre-test check or retry for Neo4j service availability to reduce false negatives in CI.
- Document the dependency on Neo4j for integration tests more prominently.
- Explore mocking or stubbing Neo4j for non-integration test runs to allow logic validation even when the service is unavailable.

## Next Steps
- Unblock the Neo4j service and re-run the targeted and full test suites.
- Once tests and pre-commit pass, commit and push the changes.
- Monitor for further environmental issues in CI and address as needed.
