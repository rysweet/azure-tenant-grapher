## Task Summary
Re-ran the CLI Neo4j integration tests after resolving the `_print_env_block` AttributeError and removing all related calls. Captured and analyzed the full output for container startup, password propagation, cleanup, and authentication/resource errors.

## Implementation Details
- Ran all tests in `tests/cli/` using `uv run pytest tests/cli/ -v`.
- Main test (`test_build_no_dashboard_autostarts_neo4j`) failed due to a `KeyError: 'NEO4J_AUTH'` in [`src/container_manager.py`](src/container_manager.py:271).
- The test environment set `NEO4J_PASSWORD` but not `NEO4J_AUTH`, and the code attempted to access `env['NEO4J_AUTH']` before it was set.
- Other tests were skipped due to the `RUN_DOCKER_CONFLICT_TESTS` environment variable not being set.

## Feedback Summary
**User Interactions Observed:**
- No corrections or clarifications from the user during this run.
- No expressions of frustration or requests for different approaches.

**Workflow Observations:**
- Task Complexity: 6 (moderate, multi-step diagnostic and analysis)
- Iterations Required: 1
- Time Investment: ~5 minutes
- Mode Switches: None

**Learning Opportunities:**
- The test and container startup logic are tightly coupled to environment variable propagation.
- Error surfaced immediately and was clear in the logs, aiding rapid diagnosis.
- Filename length for prompt-history/reflection files must be managed to avoid ENAMETOOLONG errors.

**Recommendations for Improvement:**
- Add a utility to always construct `NEO4J_AUTH` from `NEO4J_PASSWORD` if not present, or handle its absence gracefully in [`src/container_manager.py`](src/container_manager.py:271).
- Enforce session name truncation for prompt-history and reflection files to avoid filesystem errors.
- Consider adding a pre-check in test setup to validate all required environment variables are present.

## Next Steps
- Fix the code to ensure `NEO4J_AUTH` is set in the environment before accessing it, or construct it from `NEO4J_PASSWORD` if missing.
- Re-run the integration tests after applying the fix to confirm resolution.
