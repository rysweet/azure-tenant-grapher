## Task Summary
Branch, commit, PR, and issue creation for Neo4j autostart integration, with initial local validation and user feedback on integration test design.

## Implementation Details
- Created and switched to branch: `feat/cli-neo4j-autostart`
- Committed staged Neo4j-autostart refactor changes (SHA: bead984)
- Pushed branch and opened draft PR: https://github.com/rysweet/azure-tenant-grapher/pull/118
- Created GitHub Issue: https://github.com/rysweet/azure-tenant-grapher/issues/119
- Attempted local validation with docker/uv, but user feedback indicated this is not a true integration test and highlighted several requirements.

## Feedback Summary
**User Interactions Observed:**
- User provided direct feedback on the validation approach:
  1. Resource limits should be set for the Neo4j container.
  2. The current approach is not a true integration test.
  3. The test must not alter or damage the database.
  4. The test must work if not logged in to Azure.

**Workflow Observations:**
- Task Complexity: 8
- Iterations Required: 1 (plus feedback loop)
- Time Investment: ~10 minutes
- Mode Switches: None

**Learning Opportunities:**
- Automated validation must be implemented as a true integration test under tests/cli.
- Resource limits and test isolation are critical for safe CI/CD.
- Tests must be robust to Azure login state and avoid side effects.

**Recommendations for Improvement:**
- Enhance integration test templates to enforce resource limits and database safety.
- Add pre-checks for Azure login and test environment isolation.
- Consider automation to block PRs if integration tests are not idempotent or safe.

## Next Steps
- Design and implement a safe, resource-limited, Azure-independent integration test for Neo4j autostart under tests/cli.
- Ensure the test is idempotent, does not alter production data, and works without Azure login.
