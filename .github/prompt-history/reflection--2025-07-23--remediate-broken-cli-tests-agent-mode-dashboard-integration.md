## Task Summary
Remediated broken CLI-related tests in the Azure Tenant Grapher project, focusing on agent mode and dashboard subprocess integration. Ensured all workflow steps, compliance, and CI success.

## Implementation Details
- Reviewed and updated `.env` for correct environment variable names.
- Refactored agent mode test skip logic for proper environment variable usage.
- Converted all CLI tests to use subprocess invocation for isolation.
- Refactored dashboard invocation test for subprocess and defensive attribute access.
- Fixed type errors in [`src/cli_dashboard_manager.py`](src/cli_dashboard_manager.py) and [`src/config_manager.py`](src/config_manager.py).
- Ran all tests, resolved failures/errors, and ensured pre-commit checks passed.
- Staged, committed, and pushed all changes.
- Verified CI status: all tests and checks passed.

## Feedback Summary
**User Interactions Observed:**
- Provided workflow clarification and requested stepwise remediation.
- No expressions of dissatisfaction; workflow guidance was followed.

**Workflow Observations:**
- Task Complexity: 10/13 (multi-step, cross-file, CI enforcement)
- Iterations Required: 4 (test failures, refactor, re-run, CI check)
- Time Investment: ~2 hours
- Mode Switches: None (remained in Code mode)

**Learning Opportunities:**
- Subprocess-based CLI testing improves isolation and reliability.
- Defensive coding for test assertions prevents brittle failures.
- Prompt-history/reflection compliance is critical for workflow automation.

**Recommendations for Improvement:**
- Automate subprocess CLI test scaffolding for future CLI features.
- Enhance CI logs to surface skipped/failed tests more clearly.
- Consider a dashboard for prompt-history/reflection compliance status.

## Next Steps
- All workflow steps are complete. PR is ready for review and merge.
- Recommend running Improvement Mode to review Roo Rules and workflow for this session.
