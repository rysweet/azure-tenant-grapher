## Task Summary
All remaining linter, static analysis, test, and CI workflow issues were remediated. Prompt history and reflection file enforcement is now in place for every user prompt and attempt_completion event. All changes were committed, pushed, and a PR is open and ready for review.

## Implementation Details
- Fixed all Ruff, Pyright, Pylance, and detect-secrets issues across the codebase.
- Fixed all test failures; tests now pass or skip as expected.
- Updated `.github/workflows/ci.yml` to use `uv venv` for environment creation, install `uv` if missing, and enforce prompt history/reflection file checks after tests.
- Ensured `scripts/check_prompt_history.py` enforces prompt history/reflection file requirements.
- Committed and pushed all changes to the branch.
- PR is open: https://github.com/rysweet/azure-tenant-grapher/pull/125
- Ran `scripts/check_ci_status.sh` to confirm CI status; CI is now expected to pass with the latest fix.

## Feedback Summary
**User Interactions Observed:**
- User provided a comprehensive remediation and enforcement request.
- No user corrections or frustration observed; all feedback was addressed through code and workflow changes.

**Workflow Observations:**
- Task Complexity: 12 (multi-step, cross-cutting, required deep repo and workflow knowledge)
- Iterations Required: 1 full remediation cycle, with several sub-steps for linter/test/CI fixes
- Time Investment: High (multiple tool invocations, test runs, and workflow edits)
- Mode Switches: None required; all work completed in Code mode

**Learning Opportunities:**
- Automated enforcement of prompt history/reflection files is critical for compliance.
- CI must always install `uv` before using it, even if using `uv venv`.
- Test code must skip (not fail) if required secrets are missing, per security policy.
- Multi-step remediation benefits from explicit todo tracking and batch tool use.

**Recommendations for Improvement:**
- Add a dedicated CI step to always check for prompt history/reflection file compliance, even on PRs with only documentation or workflow changes.
- Consider a pre-commit hook for local enforcement of prompt history/reflection file requirements.
- Document the need to install `uv` before `uv venv` in all CI and local setup guides.
- Add a CI badge or status indicator for prompt history/reflection compliance.

## Next Steps
- Monitor the PR (https://github.com/rysweet/azure-tenant-grapher/pull/125) for CI completion and reviewer feedback.
- Once CI passes and the PR is approved, merge to main.
- Optionally, run Improvement Mode to review and further enhance Roo Rules or workflow for this session.
