## Task Summary
Remediated CI failure by ensuring NEO4J_PORT is set for `scripts/run_migrations.py` in the GitHub Actions workflow.

## Implementation Details
- Updated `.github/workflows/ci.yml` to set `NEO4J_PORT: 7687` in the environment for the "Run migrations" step.
- Added a comment referencing `.env.example` and the requirement for NEO4J_PORT.
- Committed as: `ci: set NEO4J_PORT for migration and CLI steps` (SHA: 9d5ff39).
- Pushed to remote and verified CI status using `gh run list` and `scripts/check_ci_status.sh <run_id>`.
- CI completed successfully.

## Feedback Summary
**User Interactions Observed:**
- User clarified that the correct way to check CI status is to use the `gh` CLI to obtain the run ID.
- No expressions of frustration or dissatisfaction.
- No requests for different approaches.

**Workflow Observations:**
- Task Complexity: 5 (moderate, required multi-step CI and workflow edits)
- Iterations Required: 1 (no rework required)
- Time Investment: ~15 minutes
- Mode Switches: None

**Learning Opportunities:**
- Using `gh run list` to programmatically obtain the workflow run ID is essential for CI status automation.
- The workflow for updating CI environment variables and confirming their effect is robust.
- Prompt-history and reflection file requirements are enforced and tracked.

**Recommendations for Improvement:**
- Consider updating `scripts/check_ci_status.sh` to automatically determine the run ID for the current branch, reducing manual steps.
- Add a note to the developer documentation about using `gh run list` for CI status checks.
- Continue enforcing prompt-history and reflection file creation for all multi-step tasks.

## Next Steps
- No further action required for this task.
- Optionally, automate run ID retrieval in CI status scripts for future workflow improvements.
