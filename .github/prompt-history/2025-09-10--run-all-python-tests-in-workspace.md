**Task**: Run all Python tests in the workspace to confirm passing status and identify any regressions.

**Required Actions**:
- Execute `uv run pytest -v` in the workspace root (`/Users/ryan/src/msec/atg-0723/azure-tenant-grapher`).
- Summarize results: for each test, report pass/fail and any errors, including relevant traceback or output details.

**Scope**:
- Do not fix or modify any code, tests, dependencies, or documentation at this step.
- Do not proceed with CI or commit/push.
- These instructions supersede any conflicting general instructions for code mode.

**Completion**:
- When the test run and summary are complete, signal with attempt_completion including a clear, concise report of all test results (pass/fail counts, regressions, errors).
