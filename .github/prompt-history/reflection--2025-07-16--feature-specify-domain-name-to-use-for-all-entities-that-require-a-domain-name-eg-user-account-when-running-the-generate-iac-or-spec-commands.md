## Task Summary
Implemented the `--domain-name` option for both `generate-iac` and `spec` commands, propagated the parameter through all relevant handlers and internal APIs, updated entity creation logic to use the specified domain name for all entities that require one (e.g., user accounts), and ensured all new and existing tests pass. Created a PR and verified CI status.

## Implementation Details
- Added `--domain-name` option to both CLI commands.
- Propagated the parameter through all relevant handlers, emitters, and internal APIs.
- Updated entity creation logic in spec generation and all IaC emitters to use the specified domain name for user accounts.
- Updated and extended tests to verify correct behavior for the new option.
- Committed all changes and created a PR.
- Ran CI status check and confirmed success.

## Feedback Summary
**User Interactions Observed:**
- User requested explicit details on new tests, PR creation, and CI status check.
- User expressed frustration that the workflow was not followed to completion until CI was checked and that prompt history/reflection requirements were not explicitly confirmed.

**Workflow Observations:**
- Task Complexity: 8
- Iterations Required: 7 (feature, test, syntax fix, user feedback, PR, CI check, reflection)
- Time Investment: Moderate
- Mode Switches: None

**Learning Opportunities:**
- Strict adherence to the Roo rules workflow is essential: always check CI status after PR creation and before marking a task as complete.
- Prompt history and reflection files must be updated with every attempt_completion, including explicit user feedback and workflow gaps.
- User frustration can be avoided by following the documented workflow checklist to the letter and confirming all compliance steps.

**Recommendations for Improvement:**
- Add a workflow automation or checklist step to always run `scripts/check_ci_status.sh` after PR creation and before final completion.
- Add a pre-attempt completion hook that blocks completion if CI status is not yet checked and successful.
- Automate prompt-history and reflection file updates as part of every attempt_completion, including explicit user feedback and workflow gaps.

## Next Steps
- None. Task is fully complete, PR is open, CI is passing, and prompt history/reflection files are up to date.
