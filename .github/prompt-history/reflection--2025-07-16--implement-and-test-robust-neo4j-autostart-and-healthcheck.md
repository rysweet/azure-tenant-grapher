## Task Summary
Implemented and tested robust Neo4j autostart, healthcheck, and port consistency for CLI/tests. All configuration is now sourced from the environment, with explicit handling in both Docker Compose and test code. The test is self-contained and does not rely on external environment state.

## Implementation Details
- Updated `docker-compose.yml` to use `${NEO4J_PORT}:7687` and added a healthcheck for Neo4j.
- Updated `.env.example` to include `NEO4J_PORT=7687`.
- Updated `src/utils/neo4j_startup.py` to require `NEO4J_PORT` in the environment and removed session-added wait-for logic.
- Updated `src/mcp_server.py` to require `NEO4J_PORT` and use it for the Bolt URI.
- Updated `tests/cli/test_build_autostart.py` to explicitly set `NEO4J_PORT` in the CLI subprocess environment, ensuring test self-containment.
- Ran `docker rm`, targeted pytest, full pytest, and pre-commit. All relevant tests pass; pre-commit issues are unrelated to this task.
- Committed and pushed as `fix(neo4j): robust autostart, healthcheck, and port consistency` (commit SHA: 9e9d281).

## Feedback Summary
**User Interactions Observed:**
- User clarified that all config must be in `.env`, not in README or test code.
- User required tests to be self-contained and not rely on external environment.
- User requested removal of session-added wait-for logic.
- User provided direct feedback on test and config handling.

**Workflow Observations:**
- Task Complexity: 8 (multi-step, cross-cutting config/code/test changes)
- Iterations Required: 6+
- Time Investment: ~1 hour
- Mode Switches: None

**Learning Opportunities:**
- Explicit environment handling in both CLI and test code is critical for reliability.
- Test self-containment is essential for reproducibility and CI stability.
- Removing unnecessary wait-for logic avoids linter issues and aligns with single-responsibility design.

**Recommendations for Improvement:**
- Add a pre-commit check to ensure all required env vars are present in `.env.example`.
- Consider a test utility for consistent env injection in CLI subprocesses.
- Document the required env setup for all integration tests in a central location.

## Next Steps
- Monitor CI for any regressions.
- Address unrelated pyright/ruff issues in future PRs.
- Merge once CI is green and review is complete.
