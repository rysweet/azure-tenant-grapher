❌ Failed to start or connect to Neo4j. Aborting.
```

## Actions Taken
1. Analyzed the issue and identified port mismatch between application and container
2. Fixed NEO4J_PORT environment variable configuration in .env file
3. Restarted Neo4j container with correct port mapping
4. Tested Neo4j connection successfully
5. Identified additional validation errors in the data model

## Resolution Status
✅ Neo4j connection issue resolved - container now properly exposed on port 7688
⚠️ Additional validation errors in create-tenant command need to be addressed

## Next Steps
- Fix validation errors in tenant specification model
- Test complete create-tenant workflow
