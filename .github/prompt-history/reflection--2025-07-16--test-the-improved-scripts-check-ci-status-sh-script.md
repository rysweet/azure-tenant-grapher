## Task Summary
Tested the improved `scripts/check_ci_status.sh` script by running it in the project root, attempted to capture and summarize the output, and documented workflow friction and user feedback.

## Implementation Details
- Ran `bash scripts/check_ci_status.sh` in the project root.
- Attempted to capture the output programmatically by tailing the script and the terminal device file.
- Encountered permission issues when trying to read the live output of the running terminal.
- User instructed to "just wait" for the script to finish, indicating a preference for manual output capture.

## Feedback Summary
**User Interactions Observed:**
- User provided feedback that the first "in progress" check should be reported by the script, and suggested a spinner or countdown for better UX.
- User instructed the agent to "just wait" rather than paste the output, after being prompted to provide it.

**Workflow Observations:**
- Task Complexity: 4 (simple diagnostic, but with UX and automation friction)
- Iterations Required: 3 (run script, prompt for output, attempt programmatic capture)
- Time Investment: ~10 minutes (waiting for script, multiple attempts)
- Mode Switches: None

**Learning Opportunities:**
- Programmatic capture of live VSCode terminal output is not feasible due to permissions and environment limitations.
- User feedback highlights the importance of immediate feedback in long-running scripts (e.g., reporting first "in progress" status, spinner/countdown).
- Manual intervention (user copy-paste) is required for output capture in this workflow.

**Recommendations for Improvement:**
- Consider updating the script to write output to a log file for easier programmatic capture and post-run analysis.
- Add a UX improvement to the script: always print the first "in progress" status, and optionally add a spinner or countdown.
- Document this limitation in the developer workflow for future automation attempts.

## Next Steps
- Wait for the user to provide the script output after completion.
- Once output is available, summarize the CI status and report as required.
