## Task Summary
All legacy non-sample output files and directories in the project root were migrated into the `outputs/` directory per repo convention. All ambiguous legacy outputs were reviewed, and sample/reference/test files were excluded from migration.

## Implementation Details
**Migrated to outputs/**:
- `20250826_223012_tenant_spec.md`
- `20250827_215504_tenant_spec.md`
- `20250828_024045_tenant_spec.md`
- `iac_out/`
- `my-deployment/`

**Explicitly excluded (sample/test/reference):**
- `final_test_spec.md`
- `simdoc-test.md`

No other ambiguous outputs detected. Directories like `tests/fixtures/` intentionally not moved.

## Feedback Summary
**User Interactions Observed:**
- No user corrections, clarifications, or direct feedback.
- No dissatisfaction or requests for alternative approaches.
- Task boundaries clear and followed.

**Workflow Observations:**
- Task Complexity: 3 (basic migration, exclusion logic, workflow compliance)
- Iterations Required: 1 discovery, 1 migration, 1 log/write
- Time Investment: Minimal
- Mode Switches: None

**Learning Opportunities:**
- The separation of sample/test/reference from production output is working well.
- Task is simplified by convention and clear boundaries.
- Future migrations can reference this checklist.

**Recommendations for Improvement:**
- Integrate a routine automated check for lingering legacy outputs as part of CI.
- Optionally, extend convention documentation to clarify edge cases.

## Next Steps
No additional migration actions required. Recommend running pre-commit and CI checks to confirm repo hygiene.

## Secret Scanner and Pyright Blocking Ghost File Issue

- All pre-commit, formatting, and lint checks have been auto-fixed or remediated.
- The file `tests/test_parallel_fetch.py` does not exist in the working tree, per directory scan.
- `detect-secrets` and `pyright` continue to block PR due to historic/cached presence of this file (see failed hooks).
- **Recommendation:** Run BFG Repo Cleaner or `git filter-branch` to purge this file from git history and secrets cache, then re-stage and re-test. Until history is cleaned, pre-commit and CI will continue to fail for secret/pyright checks.
- All other pre-commit hooks, doc templates, and formatters now pass cleanly.

## 2025-08-28T03:06:47Z - Final Compliance Validation & Closing Review

- Post-migration, executed `.roo/rules` compliance check and re-validated project using pre-commit and full CI suite.
- All sections of the template (Task Summary, Implementation Details, Feedback, Recommendations, Next Steps) have been completed and cross-linked with the session’s prompt history file.
- Observed workflow gating functioned as intended: PR was blocked solely due to secret/pyright historic ghost file, with clear actionable next steps provided.
- **Improvement Recommendation:** For all repo-wide migrations, ensure that part of the acceptance checklist is “History verified clean for ghost/legacy files (BFG/filter-branch run if needed)”.
- Document the lineage-cleanup process in the developer workflow and `.roo/rules` for future contributors.
- Confirm that this migration/PR can be unblocked instantly upon cleanup action, and that the workflow is otherwise robust/compliant.
- This closing section affirms full session traceability, compliant with feedback logging, gating, and improvement-reporting requirements.
