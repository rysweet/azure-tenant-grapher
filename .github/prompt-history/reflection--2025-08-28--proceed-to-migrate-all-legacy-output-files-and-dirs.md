## Task Summary
All legacy non-sample output files and directories in the project root were migrated into the `outputs/` directory per repo convention. All ambiguous legacy outputs were reviewed, and sample/reference/test files were excluded from migration.

## Implementation Details
**Migrated to outputs/**:
- `20250826_223012_tenant_spec.md`
- `20250827_215504_tenant_spec.md`
- `20250828_024045_tenant_spec.md`
- `iac_out/`
- `my-deployment/`

**Explicitly excluded (sample/test/reference):**
- `final_test_spec.md`
- `simdoc-test.md`

No other ambiguous outputs detected. Directories like `tests/fixtures/` intentionally not moved.

## Feedback Summary
**User Interactions Observed:**
- No user corrections, clarifications, or direct feedback.
- No dissatisfaction or requests for alternative approaches.
- Task boundaries clear and followed.

**Workflow Observations:**
- Task Complexity: 3 (basic migration, exclusion logic, workflow compliance)
- Iterations Required: 1 discovery, 1 migration, 1 log/write
- Time Investment: Minimal
- Mode Switches: None

**Learning Opportunities:**
- The separation of sample/test/reference from production output is working well.
- Task is simplified by convention and clear boundaries.
- Future migrations can reference this checklist.

**Recommendations for Improvement:**
- Integrate a routine automated check for lingering legacy outputs as part of CI.
- Optionally, extend convention documentation to clarify edge cases.

## Next Steps
No additional migration actions required. Recommend running pre-commit and CI checks to confirm repo hygiene.
