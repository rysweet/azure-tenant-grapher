## Task Summary
User questioned the need for the `--aad-mode` flag, suggesting it should be default behavior and asking when it would not be used.

## Implementation Details
- Captured user feedback in prompt-history.
- Will review CLI logic and remove the flag if unnecessary, making AAD mode the default.

## Feedback Summary
**User Interactions Observed:**
- User expressed confusion about the rationale for the flag.
- No technical dissatisfaction, but requested clarification and possible simplification.

**Workflow Observations:**
- Task Complexity: 6/13 (multi-step, now includes design reconsideration)
- Iterations Required: 3 (including feedback loop)
- Time Investment: ~25 minutes
- Mode Switches: None

**Learning Opportunities:**
- Importance of user-centered CLI design.
- Need for clear rationale when introducing configuration flags.
- Value in simplifying workflows when possible.

**Recommendations for Improvement:**
- Review all CLI flags for necessity and default behaviors.
- Document rationale for configuration options in help text and code comments.
- Engage user feedback earlier in design phase.

## Next Steps
- Refactor CLI to remove `--aad-mode` flag and make AAD mode default.
- Update tests and documentation accordingly.
- Communicate rationale and changes to user.
