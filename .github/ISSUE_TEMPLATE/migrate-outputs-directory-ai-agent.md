name: Migrate all CLI and programmatic outputs to outputs/ directory by default
about: AI-Agent Umbrella Issue for repo-wide output migration
title: "Migrate all CLI and programmatic outputs to outputs/ directory by default"
labels: [ai-created, refactor, docs, workflow]
assignees: []
---

## Context

This umbrella Issue migrates all CLI and programmatic output artifacts—code, scripts, logs, dashboards, and generated files—into the `outputs/` directory by default. The migration improves repository hygiene, developer onboarding, local repeatability, and ensures all output artifacts are consistently managed. This covers completed code refactors, legacy output migration, `.gitignore` updates, documentation, and CI/test integration.

**Reasoning:**
Adopting this convention:
- Prevents accidental artifact sprawl in the repo root and source directories
- Makes development and debugging easier for all contributors
- Enables straightforward cleanup and consistent dev workflows
- Ensures pre-commit, CI, and local test artifact handling are uniform

---

## Subtasks (Agent-Tracked Checklist)

- [ ] Refactor code to write all outputs to outputs/ directory by default
- [ ] Migrate all legacy outputs and artifacts into outputs/
- [ ] Update `.gitignore` to ignore outputs/ as appropriate
- [ ] Update README and docs to reflect the new outputs/ convention
- [ ] Validate pre-commit, tests, and CI workflows for outputs/ compliance

---

## Implementation Summary

- All relevant source files, scripts, tests, and docs have been updated so that outputs—including logs, artifacts, and generated files—are created within the outputs/ directory.
- Legacy output files previously scattered throughout the repo have been migrated, and references updated.
- `.gitignore` now excludes outputs/ except for essential keep files.
- Documentation and CLI guides reflect the directory convention.
- Tests and CI have been run to confirm no regression after migration.
