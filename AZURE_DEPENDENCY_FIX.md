# Azure Dependency Issue Fix

## Problem
The CLI is missing the `azure.mgmt.subscription` module, causing the command to fail with:
```
‚ùå Unexpected error: No module named 'azure.mgmt.subscription'
```

## Solution

### Option 1: Install Missing Azure Dependencies
```bash
# Install the missing Azure management library
uv add azure-mgmt-subscription

# Or install all Azure management dependencies
uv add azure-mgmt-resource azure-mgmt-subscription azure-identity
```

### Option 2: Check Requirements
Ensure all dependencies are properly specified in `requirements.txt` or `pyproject.toml`:

```bash
# Sync all dependencies
uv sync

# Or reinstall everything
uv pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Option 3: Verify Azure SDK Installation
```bash
# Check if Azure SDK packages are installed
uv pip list | grep azure

# If missing, install the full Azure SDK
uv add azure-mgmt-core azure-mgmt-resource azure-mgmt-subscription azure-identity
```

## Testing the Dashboard Exit Fix

The dashboard exit behavior fix **is working correctly** as demonstrated by our test. The Azure dependency issue is separate and doesn't affect the exit functionality.

To test the dashboard exit fix without Azure dependencies:
```bash
# Run our verification test
python3 test_cli_exit_fix.py

# Or run the unit tests
python3 -m pytest tests/test_cli_dashboard_exit.py -v
```

Both tests confirm that pressing 'x' now properly exits the entire CLI process.

## Next Steps

1. **For the Azure dependency issue**: Add the missing Azure packages to your project dependencies
2. **For the dashboard exit fix**: The fix is complete and working - pressing 'x' now terminates the entire process as expected

The dashboard exit regression has been successfully resolved!
