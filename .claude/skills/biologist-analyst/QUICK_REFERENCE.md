# Biologist Analyst - Quick Reference

## TL;DR

Analyzes living systems through biological frameworks using evolution, molecular biology, ecology, and systems biology. Connects mechanisms across molecular to ecosystem scales.

## When to Use

- Evolutionary questions and adaptations
- Disease mechanisms and treatments
- Biotechnology applications (CRISPR, GMOs)
- Ecological interactions and conservation
- Molecular and cellular processes
- Physiological systems and homeostasis

## Core Frameworks

1. **Evolution by Natural Selection** - Variation, heredity, selection, adaptation
2. **Molecular Biology** - DNA → RNA → Protein, gene regulation
3. **Ecology** - Niches, interactions, energy flow, nutrient cycles
4. **Cell Biology** - Organization, organelles, signaling
5. **Genetics** - Inheritance, mutations, population genetics

## Theoretical Foundations

- **Evolution**: Common ancestry, adaptation, speciation, co-evolution
- **Central Dogma**: DNA → RNA → Protein (with exceptions)
- **Structure-Function**: Form enables function at all scales
- **Homeostasis**: Regulation maintains stable internal conditions
- **Levels of Organization**: Molecular → cellular → organismal → population → ecosystem

## Quick Analysis Process

1. **Define Question** - What biological phenomenon? Which levels?
2. **Gather Context** - Known mechanisms, evolutionary history
3. **Select Levels** - Molecular, cellular, organismal, population, ecosystem
4. **Apply Frameworks** - Evolution, structure-function, ecology, molecular
5. **Evolutionary Context** - Adaptive significance, phylogeny
6. **Mechanisms** - How it works at each level
7. **Evidence** - Experimental support, alternatives ruled out?
8. **Applications** - Health, conservation, biotech relevance
9. **Communicate** - Connect levels, explain clearly

## Key Questions

- **Evolution**: How did this evolve? What selection pressures? Adaptive significance?
- **Mechanism**: How does it work molecularly, cellularly, physiologically?
- **Structure-Function**: How does form enable function?
- **Ecology**: What interactions matter? How does environment affect organism?
- **Evidence**: What experiments support this? Alternative explanations?

## Levels of Organization

1. **Molecular** - DNA, RNA, proteins, metabolites
2. **Cellular** - Organelles, cells, cell signaling
3. **Tissue** - Groups of similar cells
4. **Organ** - Multiple tissues
5. **Organism** - Individual
6. **Population** - Same species, defined area
7. **Community** - All populations in area
8. **Ecosystem** - Community + abiotic factors
9. **Biosphere** - All ecosystems

## Common Pitfalls

- Ignoring evolutionary context
- Teleological thinking ("purpose" instead of "function")
- Confusing correlation and causation
- Overlooking scale-dependent phenomena
- Anthropomorphizing organisms
- Ignoring ecological context
- Separating structure from function
- Forgetting about variation

## Key Principles

**Dobzhansky**: "Nothing in biology makes sense except in light of evolution"

**Central Dogma**: DNA → RNA → Protein (Crick, 1958)

**Cell Theory**: All organisms made of cells; all cells from pre-existing cells

**Natural Selection**: Variation + Heredity + Selection = Evolution

**Homeostasis**: Maintenance of stable internal conditions via feedback loops

**Ecology**: "Everything is connected to everything else" (Commoner)
