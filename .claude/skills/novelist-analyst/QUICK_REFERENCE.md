# Novelist Analyst - Quick Reference

## TL;DR

Analyzes events through narrative lens using story structure, character arcs, and dramatic theory to reveal human motivations, emotional truth, and thematic meaning.

## When to Use

- Leadership journeys and transformations
- Organizational narratives and culture
- Crisis and conflict analysis (human dimensions)
- Cultural moments and movements
- Character motivation and development
- Understanding "the story" of events

## Core Frameworks

1. **Three-Act Structure** - Setup (25%), confrontation (50%), resolution (25%)
2. **Hero's Journey** - 12-stage monomyth: departure, initiation, return
3. **Character Arc** - Positive (growth), negative (fall), flat (steadfast)
4. **Conflict Types** - Character vs. character, self, society, nature, technology, fate

## Key Story Elements

- **Inciting Incident**: Event that disrupts status quo
- **Turning Points**: Moments that change direction
- **Midpoint**: Major reversal or revelation
- **Dark Night**: Lowest point, crisis
- **Climax**: Confrontation with central conflict
- **Resolution**: New equilibrium, transformation

## Quick Analysis Process

1. **Identify Story Stage** - Where are we in the arc?
2. **Map Plot** - Inciting incident → rising action → climax → resolution
3. **Analyze Character** - Desires, needs, flaws, arc
4. **Identify Conflict** - What's at stake? What obstacles?
5. **Extract Themes** - What's this really about?
6. **Assess Coherence** - Does it hold together?
7. **Consider Perspective** - Whose story is told?
8. **Assess Trajectory** - Where is this headed?

## Key Questions

- Who is the protagonist? What do they want? Need?
- What's the fatal flaw?
- Where are we in the story arc?
- What's the core conflict? What's at stake?
- What are the turning points?
- What themes emerge?
- Does the narrative cohere?
- What would satisfying resolution require?

## Common Story Types

- **Tragedy**: Fatal flaw leads to downfall
- **Redemption Arc**: Fall, recognition, transformation
- **Rise and Fall**: Success followed by corruption/failure
- **Quest**: Journey to achieve goal
