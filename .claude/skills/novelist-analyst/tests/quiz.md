## Scenario 1: Character Arc in Crisis Narrative

**Event Description**:
A protagonist, Elena (32), is a successful corporate lawyer who has spent 10 years building her career after escaping poverty. She is driven, emotionally guarded, and defines herself by professional achievement. Inciting incident: Her estranged younger brother Marco (26) reappears after 8 years, now homeless and addicted to opioids, begging for help. Elena's internal conflict: Her instinct is to refuse (self-preservation, resentment about past betrayals) but guilt and family loyalty pull at her. External pressure: Their dying mother asks Elena to help Marco; Elena's partner threatens to leave if she enables Marco's addiction; her firm is considering her for partner (demanding all her time). Over the story, Elena attempts to help Marco (paying for rehab, letting him stay with her) but he repeatedly relapses and steals from her. Crisis point: Marco overdoses in her apartment; she must decide whether to call 911 (revealing the situation to her firm and partner) or cover it up. The choice forces Elena to confront what she truly values.

**Analysis Task**:
Analyze Elena's character arc and recommend narrative choices for her transformation.

### Expected Analysis Elements

- [ ] **Character Arc Framework**:
  - Flat vs. dynamic character (Elena must be dynamic for compelling arc)
  - Want vs. Need: Elena wants career success and control; needs emotional connection and forgiveness
  - Lie vs. Truth: Elena believes self-sufficiency and emotional walls protect her; truth is that vulnerability and connection are necessary for wholeness
  - Arc types: Positive change (learns truth), negative change (tragic), flat (steadfast in truth)

- [ ] **Internal Conflict Structure**:
  - Desire line (career success) vs. moral line (family obligation)
  - Ghost/wound: Elena's poverty trauma drives achievement but also emotional walls
  - Defense mechanisms: Workaholism, emotional distance, control
  - Stakes escalation: Each choice raises personal cost

- [ ] **Crisis Point Analysis**:
  - True dilemma: No easy answer (both choices have severe consequences)
  - Reveal character essence: What Elena chooses reveals who she is vs. who she wants to be
  - Point of no return: Decision irrevocably changes her trajectory
  - Options: Call 911 (vulnerability, potential loss) vs. cover up (moral compromise, isolation)

- [ ] **Transformation Mechanics**:
  - Catalysts: Marco's presence forces Elena to confront her past and values
  - Resistance: Elena's attempts to control the situation fail (cannot fix Marco)
  - Reversal: Moment of recognition (cannot protect herself from pain, must choose authenticity)
  - Resolution: New equilibrium (transformed relationship to success, family, vulnerability)

- [ ] **Thematic Depth**:
  - Central question: What are we obligated to sacrifice for family?
  - Subthemes: Class trauma, addiction, ambition vs. connection, control illusion
  - Moral complexity: No villain (Marco is not evil, addiction is disease; Elena's self-protection is understandable)
  - Universal resonance: Audience sees their own conflicts reflected

- [ ] **Literary Parallels**:
  - Familial obligation: Antigone (duty vs. law), The Glass Castle (Jeannette Walls)
  - Addiction narratives: Beautiful Boy, Requiem for a Dream, Long Day's Journey Into Night
  - Success and cost: The Price (Arthur Miller), The Great Gatsby
  - Transformation through crisis: Crime and Punishment, A Christmas Carol

### Evaluation Criteria

- **Domain Accuracy** (0-10): Correct application of character arc theory, dramatic structure
- **Analytical Depth** (0-10): Thoroughness of internal conflict, transformation mechanics, thematic analysis
- **Insight Specificity** (0-10): Clear narrative recommendations with craft reasoning
- **Historical Grounding** (0-10): References to literary parallels, precedents
- **Reasoning Clarity** (0-10): Logical flow from character to conflict to transformation

**Minimum Passing Score**: 35/50

## Scenario 2: Multi-POV Narrative Structure for Political Intrigue

**Event Description**:
Setting: A fictional parliamentary democracy during a constitutional crisis. Three protagonists with conflicting goals: (1) Prime Minister Amara, 55, career politician facing no-confidence vote, believes she must make pragmatic compromises to keep government functioning; (2) Opposition Leader Kai, 42, idealistic reformer who sees the crisis as opportunity for systemic change but risks destabilizing the country; (3) General Sofia, 50, military chief who took oath to constitution, watches politicians fail and faces pressure from fellow officers to intervene (coup precedents in this nation's history). Timeline: 7 days from crisis eruption to constitutional deadline. Each character has partial information and makes decisions that affect the others. Central question: Can democracy survive this crisis, or will pragmatic authoritarianism emerge? Tone: Political thriller with moral complexity (no clear heroes or villains).

**Analysis Task**:
Design the narrative structure and POV strategy to maximize tension and thematic depth.

### Expected Analysis Elements

- [ ] **POV Strategy**:
  - Third-person limited (most flexibility) vs. first-person (intimacy) vs. omniscient (overview)
  - Multiple POVs required: Each protagonist has crucial information others lack
  - POV switching mechanics: By chapter, by scene, or intercut within scenes?
  - Reliability: Should any POV be subtly unreliable to create irony?

- [ ] **Structural Architecture**:
  - Parallel timelines converging toward climax (7-day countdown creates urgency)
  - Information revelation strategy: What does each character know, when?
  - Dramatic irony: Reader knows more than individual characters (builds tension)
  - Convergence point: When do characters' paths intersect with full stakes visible?

- [ ] **Tension Mechanics**:
  - Ticking clock: Constitutional deadline (external pressure)
  - Conflicting goals: Each protagonist's success threatens others
  - Escalation: Each character's actions raise stakes for others
  - Dilemma sharpening: Choices become harder as options narrow

- [ ] **Character Differentiation Through POV**:
  - Voice distinction: Amara (pragmatic, weary), Kai (passionate, idealistic), Sofia (disciplined, conflicted)
  - Worldview filters: Each interprets events through their lens
  - Blind spots: Amara underestimates public anger; Kai underestimates chaos risk; Sofia overestimates military neutrality
  - Sympathy distribution: Reader must understand all three, even if disagreeing

- [ ] **Thematic Complexity**:
  - Central tension: Democracy's messiness vs. authoritarian efficiency
  - No easy answers: Each character represents legitimate values
  - Idealism vs. pragmatism: Kai's vision vs. Amara's realism
  - Institutional loyalty: Sofia's oath vs. nation's needs (as she perceives them)
  - Historical resonance: Weimar Republic collapse, Chilean coup, recent backsliding

- [ ] **Structural Precedents**:
  - Multiple POV political thrillers: The Winds of War, A Man for All Seasons, House of Cards
  - Countdown structure: 24, Fail Safe, On the Beach
  - Moral complexity: Le Carré (Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy), The Wire
  - Tragic inevitability: Greek tragedy structure applied to political crisis

### Evaluation Criteria

- **Domain Accuracy** (0-10): Correct application of POV theory, structural craft
- **Analytical Depth** (0-10): Thoroughness of tension mechanics, thematic integration
- **Insight Specificity** (0-10): Clear structural recommendations with craft reasoning
- **Historical Grounding** (0-10): References to narrative precedents, genre conventions
- **Reasoning Clarity** (0-10): Logical structure choices supporting theme and tension

**Minimum Passing Score**: 35/50

## Scenario 3: Setting as Character in Environmental Apocalypse Novel

**Event Description**:
Setting: A coastal city, population 2 million, facing slow-motion environmental collapse over 20 years. Climate change causes: Rising seas (neighborhoods flooding regularly), extreme heat (summer deaths), water scarcity (aquifer depletion), and ecosystem collapse (fisheries gone). Social stratification: Wealthy neighborhoods build seawalls and have backup generators; poor neighborhoods are unprotected and lose power during heat waves. Government is dysfunctional (corruption, denial, paralysis). Some residents adapt (floating homes, rainwater collection, urban farming); others flee (those who can afford it); many are trapped. Protagonist: Lena, 35, urban planner who grew up in the city, devoted to saving it despite deteriorating conditions. Her character arc involves confronting whether to stay (loyalty, hope) or leave (survival, accepting loss). The city itself must function as more than backdrop—its decay parallels Lena's psychological journey, its resilience reflects human resilience.

**Analysis Task**:
Develop the setting as an active narrative element and design its integration with character arc.

### Expected Analysis Elements

- [ ] **Setting as Character Framework**:
  - Agency: How does the city actively shape events (not just backdrop)?
  - Personality: What are the city's defining traits (resilient, decaying, beautiful, cruel)?
  - Arc: Does the city change over the story (decline, adaptation, transformation)?
  - Relationship: How does Lena relate to the city (lover, enemy, patient)?

- [ ] **Sensory and Atmospheric Craft**:
  - Five senses grounding: Heat oppression, salt smell, flood water taste, siren sounds, crumbling texture
  - Pathetic fallacy avoidance: Environment is indifferent, not mirroring emotions
  - Specificity: Concrete details (not "the city is dying" but "the subway station at 5th Street is now a reef")
  - Rhythm: Setting descriptions match narrative pace (lingering in calm, staccato in crisis)

- [ ] **Symbolic Layering**:
  - Objective correlative: City's decay as external manifestation of internal loss
  - Contrast: Decaying infrastructure vs. vibrant community adaptation
  - Thematic resonance: Environmental collapse as metaphor for institutional/moral collapse
  - Restraint: Symbolism emerges from concrete detail, not allegorical abstraction

- [ ] **Plot Integration**:
  - Setting as obstacle: Flooding disrupts Lena's plans, heat exhaustion during critical moment
  - Setting as catalyst: City's needs force Lena's choices
  - Setting as stakes: What is lost if Lena leaves? What is saved?
  - Climax location: Final confrontation in symbolically resonant space

- [ ] **Worldbuilding Depth**:
  - Material culture: How do people adapt? (technology, architecture, social practices)
  - Class and geography: Spatial mapping of inequality (high ground vs. flood zones)
  - Institutional responses: Government failure vs. grassroots resilience
  - Temporal layering: Past beauty vs. present decay vs. uncertain future

- [ ] **Literary Precedents**:
  - Setting as character: Yoknapatawpha (Faulkner), Dublin (Joyce), Macondo (García Márquez)
  - Environmental decay: The Road (McCarthy), Parable of the Sower (Butler), Flight Behavior (Kingsolver)
  - Urban collapse: The City & The City (Miéville), Zone One (Whitehead)
  - Place and identity: Beloved (Morrison), Housekeeping (Robinson)

### Evaluation Criteria

- **Domain Accuracy** (0-10): Correct application of setting craft, sensory grounding
- **Analytical Depth** (0-10): Thoroughness of atmospheric, symbolic, plot integration
- **Insight Specificity** (0-10): Clear craft recommendations for setting-character integration
- **Historical Grounding** (0-10): References to literary precedents in setting-as-character
- **Reasoning Clarity** (0-10): Logical integration of setting with theme and character arc

**Minimum Passing Score**: 35/50

## Scenario 4: Unreliable Narrator in Psychological Thriller

**Event Description**:
Protagonist/Narrator: Maya, 28, claims she is being stalked by a stranger who leaves threatening notes, follows her, and breaks into her apartment. She reports this to police (who find no evidence), tells her therapist (who suggests trauma response), and confides in her sister (who is skeptical). Maya's backstory: Survived a violent assault 5 years ago; has PTSD; takes medication; had a previous episode of paranoia that turned out to be unfounded. Reader question: Is the stalker real, or is Maya experiencing psychosis? The narrative must maintain ambiguity until late in the story. Clues throughout: Some evidence supports Maya (photos that might show someone, disturbed objects) and some suggests delusion (only she sees stalker, her memory has gaps, medications cause hallucinations). Reveal strategy options: (1) Stalker is real, vindication for Maya; (2) Stalker is delusion, tragic mental health crisis; (3) Ambiguous, reader decides. Tone: Tense, intimate, claustrophobic.

**Analysis Task**:
Design the unreliable narrator strategy to maintain productive ambiguity and deliver satisfying resolution.

### Expected Analysis Elements

- [ ] **Unreliable Narrator Typology**:
  - Madman (mental illness distorts perception) vs. Liar (conscious deception) vs. Naïf (limited understanding)
  - Maya as Madman type: Unreliability from PTSD/medication, not intentional
  - Reader contract: What do we trust? (Sensory details ambiguous, emotions genuine)
  - Fair play: Clues for both interpretations planted early

- [ ] **Narrative Technique**:
  - First-person present tense (immediacy, no retrospective reliability)
  - Selective detail: What Maya notices reveals her state (paranoid focus)
  - Gaps and ellipses: Memory blanks, time jumps (raise doubt)
  - Style shifts: Calm narration vs. fragmented panic (signal unreliability)

- [ ] **Ambiguity Management**:
  - Dual plausibility: Both stalker-real and stalker-delusion must be credible throughout
  - Evidence balancing: For every "stalker is real" clue, provide "Maya is unwell" counter-clue
  - Red herrings: Misleading but fair clues (sister's evasiveness could be concern or conspiracy)
  - Reader positioning: Encourage active interpretation, not passive reception

- [ ] **Resolution Strategy**:
  - **Option 1 (Stalker real)**: Vindication but risks predictability; requires strong final evidence
  - **Option 2 (Delusion)**: Tragic but risks feeling like betrayal; requires compassion
  - **Option 3 (Ambiguous)**: Thematically rich (unknowability of others' minds) but risks frustration
  - Criteria: Which serves thematic purpose? What is story ultimately about? (trauma, trust, perception)

- [ ] **Thematic Depth**:
  - Central question: How do we know what we know?
  - Epistemic uncertainty: Maya's doubt about her own perceptions
  - Trauma and trust: PTSD makes world feel hostile
  - Social epistemology: When authorities/loved ones don't believe, what happens to reality?
  - Reader complicity: We doubt Maya partly because she's a woman with mental health issues (examine our biases)

- [ ] **Literary Precedents**:
  - Unreliable narrators: Gone Girl (Flynn), The Turn of the Screw (James), Fight Club (Palahniuk)
  - Psychological ambiguity: Memento, Shutter Island, Black Swan
  - Trauma narration: The Woman in the Window, Sharp Objects
  - Gaslighting narratives: Gaslight (1944), Big Little Lies

### Evaluation Criteria

- **Domain Accuracy** (0-10): Correct application of unreliable narrator technique, fair play principles
- **Analytical Depth** (0-10): Thoroughness of ambiguity mechanics, resolution strategy, thematic integration
- **Insight Specificity** (0-10): Clear craft recommendations for maintaining productive ambiguity
- **Historical Grounding** (0-10): References to unreliable narrator precedents, genre conventions
- **Reasoning Clarity** (0-10): Logical narrative choices supporting theme and reader experience

**Minimum Passing Score**: 35/50

## Scenario 5: Subplot Integration in Ensemble Family Drama

**Event Description**:
Main plot: The Zhang family gathers for their patriarch's 80th birthday in their ancestral home. Mr. Zhang is dying (cancer, months left), and the gathering forces confrontation with buried tensions. Five family members, each with subplot: (1) Eldest son David (52), successful but emotionally distant, hiding financial collapse; (2) Middle daughter Lisa (48), caregiver who sacrificed career, resents siblings' absence; (3) Youngest son Tom (45), estranged after coming out 20 years ago, brings his husband; (4) Mr. Zhang's second wife Mei (55), whom the children resent for replacing their dead mother; (5) Granddaughter Emma (22), David's daughter, struggling with identity and family legacy. Setting: 4 days together in the house. Each character has personal crisis that intersects with family crisis. Challenge: Integrate 5 subplots without losing main plot (family reckoning) or making story feel scattered.

**Analysis Task**:
Design subplot integration strategy and thematic weaving for coherent ensemble narrative.

### Expected Analysis Elements

- [ ] **Subplot Hierarchy and Function**:
  - A-plot (main): Family confronts patriarch's legacy and their relationships
  - B-plots (subplots): Individual characters' crises (David's finances, Lisa's resentment, Tom's estrangement)
  - Subplot functions: Illuminate main theme, complicate central conflict, provide pacing variation
  - Integration principle: Each subplot must connect to A-plot thematically and causally

- [ ] **Structural Weaving**:
  - Braiding technique: Switch between plots at moments of tension (not arbitrary)
  - Convergence points: Subplots intersect with A-plot (David's secret revealed at dinner; Tom and father reconcile)
  - Pacing rhythm: Alternate between intimate (subplot focus) and ensemble (A-plot) scenes
  - Climax unification: All plots peak simultaneously at family confrontation

- [ ] **Thematic Coherence**:
  - Central theme: Legacy and obligation (what do we owe family? what do they owe us?)
  - Subplot variations: David (legacy as burden), Lisa (obligation as sacrifice), Tom (authenticity vs. family), Mei (outsider seeking belonging), Emma (inheriting vs. choosing)
  - Motif repetition: Each plot explores theme from different angle
  - Resonance: Subplots echo and amplify main plot

- [ ] **Character Relationship Matrix**:
  - Dyads: Each pair has history (David-Lisa tension, Tom-father estrangement, children-Mei conflict)
  - Triangles: Three-way dynamics (David-Lisa-Tom sibling coalition; Mr. Zhang-Mei-children)
  - Alliances shift: Emma connects different generations; Tom's husband is sympathetic outsider
  - Ensemble scenes: Everyone together (birthday dinner, final confrontation) show full web

- [ ] **Narrative Economy**:
  - Scenes serve multiple functions: Advance A-plot AND B-plot simultaneously
  - Dialogue efficiency: One conversation reveals multiple character dimensions
  - Subtext: Characters talk about one thing while meaning another
  - Pruning: Cut subplots that don't thematically connect (no matter how interesting)

- [ ] **Literary Precedents**:
  - Ensemble family dramas: August: Osage County (Letts), Little Fires Everywhere (Ng), The Corrections (Franzen)
  - Gathering structure: The Big Chill, The Descendants, Fences
  - Multi-POV family: Everything I Never Told You (Ng), The House of the Spirits (Allende)
  - Thematic coherence: Cloud Atlas (Mitchell), A Visit from the Goon Squad (Egan)

### Evaluation Criteria

- **Domain Accuracy** (0-10): Correct application of subplot structure, ensemble craft
- **Analytical Depth** (0-10): Thoroughness of integration strategy, thematic weaving
- **Insight Specificity** (0-10): Clear craft recommendations for coherent ensemble narrative
- **Historical Grounding** (0-10): References to ensemble narrative precedents
- **Reasoning Clarity** (0-10): Logical integration of multiple plots without fragmentation

**Minimum Passing Score**: 35/50
