# Urban Planner Analyst - Quick Reference

## TL;DR

Analyzes urban development through planning lens using comprehensive plans, zoning, transit-oriented development, and equity frameworks. Evaluates land use, transportation, housing, sustainability, and implementation.

## When to Use

- Development project review
- Comprehensive plan or zoning updates
- Transportation and TOD planning
- Affordable housing strategy
- Sustainability and climate action
- Downtown revitalization
- Equity and anti-displacement planning

## Core Frameworks

1. **Comprehensive Planning** - Long-range vision, land use, transportation, housing, implementation
2. **Zoning and Land Use** - Compliance, form-based codes, regulatory tools
3. **Transit-Oriented Development** - 3V Framework: Node, Place, Market
4. **Environmental/Sustainability** - LEED-ND, green infrastructure, climate resilience
5. **Housing Affordability** - Inclusionary zoning, anti-displacement, needs assessment

## Theoretical Foundations

- **Comprehensive Planning**: Rational model, 20-30 year vision
- **Zoning**: Euclidean (use-based), form-based (design-based)
- **TOD**: Mixed-use, walkable, dense near transit (1/4-1/2 mile)
- **New Urbanism/Smart Growth**: Traditional neighborhoods, anti-sprawl, infill
- **Equity Planning**: Environmental justice, anti-displacement, community voice

## Quick Analysis Process

1. **Context** - Plans, regulations, community history
2. **Existing Conditions** - Land use, transportation, housing, environment
3. **Consistency** - Comprehensive plan, zoning compliance
4. **Impacts** - Transportation, environment, housing, fiscal, equity
5. **Alternatives** - Develop scenarios, compare
6. **Recommendations** - Policies, mitigation, implementation
7. **Engagement** - Workshops, surveys, co-creation
8. **Decision** - Staff report, hearings, adoption
9. **Implementation** - Zoning updates, CIP, monitoring

## Key Questions

- Is it consistent with the comprehensive plan?
- Does it comply with zoning or need relief?
- What are transportation impacts (VMT, LOS, multimodal)?
- Environmental impacts and mitigation?
- Housing added? Affordable? Displacement risk?
- Fiscal impact (revenue vs. costs)?
- Who benefits? Who is burdened?
- Were affected communities meaningfully engaged?

## Core Planning Principles

- **Public Interest**: Balance individual rights with community welfare
- **Long-Term Perspective**: Decisions shape communities for generations
- **Integrated Systems**: Land use, transportation, environment interconnected
- **Place-Based**: Context matters, local solutions
- **Equity and Justice**: Address historical harms, fair distribution
- **Sustainability**: Environmental stewardship, climate action
- **Community Participation**: Meaningful engagement, shared power
- **Evidence-Based**: Data, research, best practices

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

- Plan-zoning inconsistency (plan says one thing, zoning allows another)
- Ignoring equity and displacement impacts
- Overemphasis on parking (excessive minimums)
- Tokenistic community engagement
- Ignoring fiscal impacts (fiscally unsustainable sprawl)
- Car-centric planning (neglecting other modes)
- "Neighborhood character" as exclusion
- Ignoring climate change impacts

## Essential Resources

- **APA**: https://www.planning.org/ (Professional association, JAPA, resources)
- **Planetizen**: https://www.planetizen.com/ (Planning news, Planopedia)
- **Census Bureau**: https://www.census.gov/ (Demographics, housing data)
- **Walk Score**: https://www.walkscore.com/ (Walkability ratings)

## Key Metrics

- **Land Use**: Density (units/acre, FAR), lot coverage, mix of uses
- **Transportation**: VMT, LOS, Walk Score, transit access
- **Housing**: Cost burden (>30% income), affordability gap, units by AMI
- **Environment**: Impervious surface, tree canopy, GHG emissions
- **Equity**: Displacement risk indicators, access to opportunity

## Zoning Tools

- **Variance**: Relief from dimensional standards
- **Conditional Use**: Special permit with conditions
- **Rezoning**: Change zoning classification
- **PUD**: Planned Unit Development (flexibility for amenities)
- **Overlay Zone**: Additional standards for specific areas

## Success Criteria

✓ Plans and regulations reviewed
✓ Existing conditions documented
✓ Impacts quantified (transportation, environment, housing, fiscal)
✓ Equity and displacement assessed
✓ Community meaningfully engaged
✓ Alternatives compared
✓ Recommendations evidence-based
✓ Implementation plan with timeline and budget
✓ Sustainability and climate considered
