# Urban Planner Analyst Skill

> **Analyze urban development and spatial organization through planning frameworks to create sustainable, equitable, livable communities.**

## Overview

The Urban Planner Analyst skill enables Claude to perform sophisticated analysis of cities, development projects, and planning policies. Drawing on established planning frameworks, theories, and evidence-based practices, this skill provides insights into:

- **Land Use and Zoning**: Comprehensive plans, zoning compliance, development patterns
- **Transportation Planning**: Transit systems, walkability, complete streets, TOD
- **Housing and Affordability**: Housing needs, inclusionary zoning, anti-displacement
- **Sustainability**: Climate action, green infrastructure, VMT reduction, resilience
- **Equity and Justice**: Fair distribution of benefits, anti-displacement, community engagement
- **Implementation**: Regulatory reform, capital improvements, fiscal analysis

## What Makes This Different

Unlike general urban analysis, urban planner analysis:

1. **Spatial Thinking**: Analyzes how location, geography, and proximity shape outcomes
2. **Integrated Systems**: Connects land use, transportation, environment, housing, economy
3. **Long-Term Perspective**: Plans for 20-30 year horizons
4. **Public Interest Focus**: Balances individual rights with community welfare
5. **Implementation Oriented**: Translates vision to concrete actions (zoning, budgets, programs)
6. **Evidence-Based**: Grounds decisions in data, research, best practices

## Use Cases

### Development Review

- Evaluate proposed residential, commercial, mixed-use projects
- Assess comprehensive plan and zoning consistency
- Analyze impacts (transportation, environmental, fiscal, community)
- Recommend conditions of approval or improvements

### Policy Development

- Design zoning codes and comprehensive plans
- Develop affordable housing strategies
- Create climate action and sustainability plans
- Establish design guidelines and form-based codes

### Transportation Planning

- Analyze transit-oriented development opportunities
- Evaluate complete streets and bike/ped improvements
- Assess parking policies and management
- Coordinate land use and transportation

### Equity and Affordability

- Assess displacement risks and mitigation
- Design inclusionary zoning and community benefits
- Evaluate equitable distribution of amenities and burdens
- Plan inclusive community engagement

## Planning Frameworks Available

### Core Frameworks

- **Comprehensive Planning**: Long-range vision and policy foundation
- **Zoning Analysis**: Compliance, variances, rezonings, form-based codes
- **Transit-Oriented Development**: 3V Framework (node, place, market value)
- **Environmental Assessment**: LEED-ND, green infrastructure, climate impact
- **Housing Affordability**: Needs assessment, inclusionary zoning, anti-displacement

### Theoretical Foundations

- **Comprehensive Planning**: Rational planning model, long-range vision
- **Zoning and Land Use**: Euclidean and form-based, regulatory tools
- **Transit-Oriented Development**: Mixed-use, walkable, station areas
- **New Urbanism and Smart Growth**: Traditional neighborhoods, infill, anti-sprawl
- **Equity Planning**: Environmental justice, anti-displacement, community voice

### Methodological Approaches

- Comprehensive planning process (10 steps)
- Site plan and development review
- Community engagement and participatory planning
- GIS and spatial analysis
- Fiscal impact analysis

## Quick Start

### Basic Usage

```
Claude, use the urban-planner-analyst skill to analyze [PROJECT/POLICY].

Examples:
- "Use urban-planner-analyst to evaluate the proposed mixed-use development."
- "Analyze the comprehensive plan update using urban-planner-analyst."
- "Use planner skill to assess affordable housing strategies."
```

### Advanced Usage

```
"Use urban-planner-analyst to evaluate the TOD proposal using the 3V Framework and
assess transit-oriented development suitability."

"Apply urban-planner-analyst to analyze displacement risks and design anti-displacement
strategies for the neighborhood plan."

"Use urban-planner-analyst to compare growth scenarios and their fiscal, environmental,
and equity impacts."
```

## Analysis Process

The urban planner analyst follows a systematic 9-step process:

1. **Understand Context** - Geography, plans, regulations, community history, stakeholders
2. **Analyze Existing Conditions** - Land use, transportation, housing, economy, environment, equity
3. **Evaluate Plan/Zoning Consistency** - Comprehensive plan, zoning compliance, needed relief
4. **Assess Impacts** - Transportation, environment, housing, fiscal, community, equity
5. **Develop Alternatives** - Generate scenarios, compare on key criteria, model outcomes
6. **Formulate Recommendations** - Policies, regulations, mitigation, implementation actions
7. **Engage Community** - Workshops, surveys, deliberation, co-creation, feedback loops
8. **Facilitate Decision-Making** - Staff reports, presentations, hearings, adoption
9. **Plan Implementation** - Regulatory updates, capital improvements, funding, monitoring

## Example Analyses

### Example 1: Transit-Oriented Development

**Situation**: 300-unit mixed-use building at light rail station, requesting density bonus and reduced parking.

**Analysis Highlights**:

- TOD district comp plan designation → Consistent
- High Walk Score (78) and Transit Score (85) → Supports reduced parking
- Inclusionary zoning: 45 affordable units (15%) at 60% AMI
- Parking: 0.5 spaces/unit justified by TOD location and data
- Fiscal impact: $10M net annual positive
- Recommendations: Approve with affordable housing, parking unbundling, anti-displacement contribution

### Example 2: Downtown Revitalization

**Situation**: Historic downtown with 30% vacancy, declining retail, aging infrastructure.

**Analysis Highlights**:

- Strategy: Zoning reform, streetscape improvements, upper-floor housing, business support
- 150 housing units in upper floors over 5 years
- $5M public investment leverages $10M private
- Reduces vacancy to <10%, adds 50 jobs, increases tax base $800K annually
- Historic preservation compatible with revitalization
- Community-driven vision through charrettes and workshops

### Example 3: Affordable Housing Strategy

**Situation**: Severe affordability crisis, 7,000-unit gap, 50% renters cost-burdened.

**Analysis Highlights**:

- Comprehensive strategy: Eliminate single-family zoning, inclusionary zoning, dedicated funding ($45M annually)
- Production goal: 500 units/year for 10 years
- Anti-displacement: Tenant protections, legal aid, community preference
- 10-year projection: 5,000 affordable units (closes 70% of gap)
- Combines regulatory reform, public investment, anti-displacement
