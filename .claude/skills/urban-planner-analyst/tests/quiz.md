## Scenario 1: Transit-Oriented Development Proposal

**Event Description**:
A mid-sized city (population 450,000) plans a new light rail transit (LRT) line connecting the downtown core to a suburban employment hub 12 miles away, with 15 stations. The city proposes rezoning areas within 1/2 mile of stations from single-family residential to mixed-use, allowing buildings up to 8 stories. The plan anticipates 8,500 new housing units and 12,000 jobs over 15 years. Current residents near proposed stations express concerns about traffic, parking, neighborhood character changes, and gentrification displacing long-term residents. The project requires $2.1 billion in infrastructure investment. Ridership projections estimate 45,000 daily riders by year 10.

**Analysis Task**:
Analyze the transit-oriented development proposal and its urban planning implications.

### Expected Analysis Elements

- [ ] **Transit-Oriented Development (TOD) Principles**:
  - High-density, mixed-use development near transit stations
  - Walkable, pedestrian-oriented design (1/2 mile = 10-minute walk)
  - Reduced auto dependency and parking requirements
  - Integration of housing, employment, retail, services
  - Support for transit ridership through proximate development

- [ ] **Land Use and Zoning Analysis**:
  - Current zoning: Single-family residential (low density)
  - Proposed zoning: Mixed-use, 8-story buildings (medium-high density)
  - Density increase: 8,500 housing units (estimate 17,000-21,000 residents)
  - Job-housing balance: 12,000 jobs + residential (reduces commute distances)
  - Floor Area Ratio (FAR) implications
  - Transition zones and height step-downs

- [ ] **Transportation Impact Assessment**:
  - Mode shift: Projected auto trips reduced by transit use
  - Traffic: Short-term construction disruption, long-term reduction near stations
  - Parking: Reduced requirements (TOD parking ratios lower than suburban)
  - Bicycle and pedestrian infrastructure needs
  - First/last mile connectivity (bus feeders, bike share)
  - Regional congestion mitigation

- [ ] **Economic and Fiscal Analysis**:
  - Capital cost: $2.1 billion (federal, state, local funding mix)

  - Property value impacts: Premiums near transit (10-20% typical)
  - Tax revenue: Increased assessed values, development fees
  - Cost-benefit ratio and economic development multipliers
  - Affordability and displacement risks

- [ ] **Equity and Gentrification Concerns**:

  - Greenhouse gas emissions: Transportation sector reductions
  - Compact development: Efficient land use, reduced sprawl
  - Green building standards: LEED, net-zero energy
  - Urban heat island mitigation: Green infrastructure, tree canopy

- [ ] **Historical Context**:

## Scenario 2: Climate Adaptation Planning

**Event Description**:
A coastal city (population 280,000) faces increasing climate risks: sea level rise projections of 2-3 feet by 2050, intensified hurricanes, and chronic "sunny day" flooding in low-lying neighborhoods. A vulnerability assessment identifies 12,000 residents in flood-prone areas, $4.5 billion in at-risk property, and critical infrastructure (wastewater treatment plant, power substations, hospital) in hazard zones. The city must balance protecting existing development, managing retreat from high-risk areas, and accommodating 15% population growth over 30 years. Funding constraints limit large-scale infrastructure (seawalls cost $10-20 million per mile). Socioeconomic disparities mean low-income communities face highest risk but least capacity to relocate.

## Scenario 3: Affordable Housing Crisis

**Event Description**:
A rapidly growing tech hub city (population 650,000) faces severe housing affordability challenges. Median home price is $875,000 (up 65% in 5 years), median rent is $2,400/month (up 45%). Cost-burdened households (>30% income on housing) comprise 52% of renters and 35% of owners. Homelessness has increased 38% in 3 years to 4,200 individuals. The jobs-housing imbalance worsens as tech employment grows 8% annually but housing production lags (3,500 units/year vs. 8,000 needed). Long commutes from distant affordable areas strain transportation systems and increase emissions. Neighborhood resistance to new development (especially multi-family) persists despite the crisis.

## Scenario 5: Regional Growth Management

**Event Description**:
A metropolitan region (1.8 million population, 5 counties, 42 municipalities) faces uncoordinated sprawl development. Over 20 years, population grew 35% but urbanized land increased 65% (low-density suburban expansion). Consequences include: VMT increased 48% (traffic congestion, emissions), agricultural land loss (45,000 acres converted), infrastructure costs ($8 billion in roads, water, sewer for dispersed development), school overcrowding in suburbs, job-housing imbalance (long commutes), and environmental impacts (habitat fragmentation, water quality degradation). The region's core cities experience population decline, vacant properties, and declining tax bases while suburbs resist affordable housing and transit.
