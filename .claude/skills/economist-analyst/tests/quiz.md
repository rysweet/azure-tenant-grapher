## Scenario 1: Carbon Tax Implementation

**Event Description**:
A government announces a $50 per ton carbon tax on all fossil fuel consumption, to be implemented in 6 months. The tax will be applied to coal, oil, and natural gas based on their carbon content. Revenue will be returned to citizens as equal per-capita dividends ("carbon dividend").

**Analysis Task**:
Provide comprehensive economic analysis of this policy.

### Expected Analysis Elements

- [ ] **Supply & Demand Analysis**: How tax affects fossil fuel markets
  - Supply curve vs. demand curve shift (tax is on suppliers but incidence depends on elasticity)
  - Expected price and quantity changes
  - Deadweight loss from tax

- [ ] **Tax Incidence**: Who really pays the tax?
  - Depends on relative elasticities of supply and demand
  - More inelastic side bears greater burden
  - Likely: Consumers bear significant share due to inelastic short-run demand

- [ ] **Time Horizon Analysis**:
  - Short-run: Limited substitution, high burden on consumers, prices rise sharply
  - Medium-run: Investment in efficiency and alternatives, behavioral changes
  - Long-run: Structural shift toward low-carbon economy

- [ ] **Distributional Effects**:
  - Regressivity concern: Low-income households spend higher share of income on energy
  - Carbon dividend can offset regressivity if properly designed
  - Regional variation: Fossil fuel-producing regions lose, clean energy regions gain

- [ ] **Efficiency Analysis**:
  - Pigouvian tax: Corrects negative externality (climate damage)
  - Internalizes social cost of carbon
  - Potential efficiency gain (reduces market failure)

- [ ] **Behavioral/Incentive Effects**:
  - Incentive to reduce fossil fuel consumption
  - Incentive to invest in energy efficiency
  - Incentive for innovation in low-carbon technologies
  - Potential for strategic behavior (timing of purchases, relocation)

- [ ] **Policy Alternatives Considered**:
  - Cap-and-trade vs. carbon tax
  - Regulation vs. price mechanism
  - Revenue recycling options

- [ ] **Empirical Grounding**:
  - Existing carbon taxes (British Columbia, Scandinavian countries)
  - Elasticity estimates for energy demand
  - Social cost of carbon estimates ($50/ton is within typical range)

### Evaluation Criteria

- **Domain Accuracy** (0-10): Correct application of tax incidence, externality theory, Pigouvian taxation
- **Analytical Depth** (0-10): Thoroughness of supply/demand analysis, time horizons, distributional effects
- **Insight Specificity** (0-10): Clear predictions about prices, quantities, behavioral responses
- **Historical Grounding** (0-10): References to existing carbon taxes, elasticity estimates
- **Reasoning Clarity** (0-10): Logical flow from theory to evidence to conclusions

**Minimum Passing Score**: 35/50

  - Near-monopoly in search (90% market share)
  - Two-sided market (users and advertisers)
  - Network effects and economies of scale
  - Barriers to entry (data, network effects, switching costs)

- [ ] **Market Power Assessment**:
  - Ability to set prices above marginal cost
  - Exclusionary practices
  - Leveraging dominance across markets
  - Harm to competition vs. consumer welfare

- [ ] **Consumer Welfare Analysis**:
  - Zero price to users (complicates traditional analysis)
  - Quality effects: Innovation incentives, service degradation
  - Dynamic efficiency: Does dominance reduce innovation?
  - Privacy and data concerns

- [ ] **Economic Efficiency**:
  - Static efficiency: Current allocation
  - Dynamic efficiency: Innovation over time
  - Deadweight loss from market power
  - Potential efficiencies from scale

- [ ] **Game Theory/Strategic Behavior**:
  - Predatory pricing or exclusion strategies
  - Strategic acquisition of competitors
  - Exclusive dealing arrangements

## Scenario 3: Central Bank Interest Rate Decision During Inflation Spike

**Event Description**:
Inflation has risen to 7% (well above the 2% target). Unemployment is 4% (near natural rate). The central bank is considering raising interest rates by 0.25% (dovish), 0.5% (moderate), or 0.75% (hawkish).

Economic context:

- Inflation driven by both supply shocks (energy, supply chain) and demand factors (fiscal stimulus)
- Housing market is booming, with rapid price appreciation
- Consumer confidence is declining due to inflation concerns
- Some supply chains are beginning to normalize

**Analysis Task**:
Analyze the trade-offs and provide a recommendation with economic justification.

### Expected Analysis Elements

- [ ] **Monetary Policy Framework**:
  - Taylor Rule logic (respond to inflation gap and output gap)
  - Transmission mechanism (interest rates → investment, consumption → aggregate demand)
  - Long and variable lags in monetary policy
  - Expectations channel (forward guidance matters)

- [ ] **Inflation Analysis**:
  - Supply-side vs. demand-side components
  - Transitory vs. persistent factors
  - Expectations (if unanchored, harder to control)
  - Phillips Curve relationship

- [ ] **Trade-Offs**:
  - **Aggressive hike** (0.75%): Controls inflation faster, but risks recession, higher unemployment
  - **Moderate hike** (0.5%): Balance, but may be insufficient if inflation persists
  - **Dovish hike** (0.25%): Avoids recession risk, but inflation may become entrenched

- [ ] **Macro Effects**:
  - Aggregate demand: Higher rates reduce consumption and investment
  - Employment: Cooling demand leads to higher unemployment (Okun's Law)
  - Exchange rate: Higher rates appreciate currency, affecting trade
  - Financial markets: Rate hikes reduce asset prices

- [ ] **Distributional Effects**:
  - Debtors vs. creditors
  - Savers vs. borrowers
  - Workers (unemployment risk) vs. fixed-income recipients (benefit from lower inflation)

- [ ] **Risk Assessment**:
  - Risk of recession if too aggressive
  - Risk of entrenched inflation if too dovish
  - Asymmetric risks (Inflation expectations un-anchoring is costly)

- [ ] **Historical Context**:
  - Volcker Fed (1980s): Aggressive rate hikes to break inflation
  - 1970s stagflation: Consequence of insufficient policy response
  - 2008 crisis: Risks of premature tightening
  - Recent supply-driven inflation episodes

### Evaluation Criteria

- **Domain Accuracy** (0-10): Correct analysis of monetary transmission, Phillips Curve, trade-offs
- **Analytical Depth** (0-10): Thoroughness of macro effects, risks, trade-offs
- **Insight Specificity** (0-10): Clear recommendation with justification
- **Historical Grounding** (0-10): References to historical episodes (Volcker, 1970s)
- **Reasoning Clarity** (0-10): Logical weighing of competing considerations

**Minimum Passing Score**: 35/50

**Event Description**:
A government proposes implementing Universal Basic Income: $1,000/month to every adult citizen, funded by:

- Elimination of existing welfare programs
- New 5% value-added tax (VAT)
- Modest increase in top marginal income tax rates

**Analysis Task**:
Analyze the economic effects and trade-offs of this proposal.

### Expected Analysis Elements

- [ ] **Labor Market Effects**:
  - Income effect: Reduces labor supply (leisure is normal good)
  - Substitution effect: No effect (UBI doesn't change wage)
  - Net effect: Likely some labor supply reduction, but magnitude debated
  - May enable entrepreneurship, education, caregiving

- [ ] **Distributional Analysis**:
  - Progressive or regressive depends on financing
  - Winners: Low-income individuals, those doing unpaid work
  - Losers: High earners (through taxation), potentially current welfare recipients if lose targeted benefits
  - Regional variation

- [ ] **Macroeconomic Effects**:
  - Aggregate demand: Increase (high MPC for low-income recipients)
  - Potential multiplier effect
  - Inflationary pressure if demand increases without supply response
  - Fiscal cost and sustainability

- [ ] **Behavioral/Incentive Effects**:
  - Reduced poverty trap (no benefit cliffs)
  - Simplified welfare system (lower administrative costs)
  - Potential for increased bargaining power for workers
  - Risk of rent extraction (landlords raising rents)

- [ ] **Efficiency Analysis**:
  - Deadweight loss from taxation (VAT, income tax)
  - Gains from eliminating welfare bureaucracy
  - Improved labor market matching (people can afford to search)
  - Trade-off: Universal vs. targeted transfers

- [ ] **Political Economy**:
  - Public choice: Constituencies for and against
  - Path dependence: Replacing existing programs is politically difficult
  - Experimental evidence needed

- [ ] **Empirical Evidence**:
  - Alaska Permanent Fund
  - Finland UBI experiment (2017-2018)
  - Kenya GiveDirectly experiment
  - Negative Income Tax experiments (1970s US)
  - Lessons: Mixed evidence on labor supply effects

## Scenario 5: Housing Market Boom and Potential Bubble

**Event Description**:
Housing prices have risen 30% over 2 years. Contributing factors:

- Low interest rates (stimulative monetary policy)
- Supply constraints (zoning, construction bottlenecks)
- Increased demand (demographic shifts, remote work enabling relocation)
- Speculative buying ("FOMO" - fear of missing out)
- Investor purchases

Some economists warn of a bubble; others argue fundamentals justify prices.

**Analysis Task**:
Analyze whether this is a bubble and what economic effects could result.

### Expected Analysis Elements

- [ ] **Bubble Analysis**:
  - Definition: Price exceeds fundamental value
  - Behavioral factors: FOMO, extrapolative expectations, herding
  - Leverage and credit availability
  - Comparison to historical bubbles (2008, 1990s Japan, 1980s US S&L crisis)

- [ ] **Supply & Demand Analysis**:
  - Demand factors: Low rates, demographics, remote work (fundamental)
  - Supply factors: Zoning, construction costs (constraints increase prices)
  - Speculative demand (not fundamental)
  - Elasticity: Housing supply is inelastic, especially in short-run

- [ ] **Credit and Financial Stability**:
  - Leverage: How much is financed with debt?
  - Lending standards: Are they loose or tight? (2008 lesson: subprime lending)
  - Systemic risk: If bubble bursts, what are spillovers?
  - Household balance sheets: Wealth effect from housing

- [ ] **Macroeconomic Effects**:
  - **If Boom Continues**: Wealth effect increases consumption, positive growth impact
  - **If Bubble Bursts**: Negative wealth effect, foreclosures, banking system stress, recession risk
  - Transmission: Housing → Construction employment, consumer spending, financial sector

- [ ] **Distributional Effects**:
  - Winners: Existing homeowners (wealth gains)
  - Losers: Renters, first-time buyers (affordability crisis)
  - Generational wealth gap (older own homes, younger priced out)

- [ ] **Policy Options**:
  - Monetary policy: Raise rates (cools housing but broad effects)
  - Macroprudential policy: Loan-to-value limits, stress tests
  - Supply-side: Zoning reform, increase construction
  - Taxation: Property taxes, capital gains taxes
  - Trade-offs of each

- [ ] **Historical Context**:
  - 2008 Financial Crisis: Housing bubble, subprime lending, systemic collapse
  - Japan 1990s: Real estate bubble burst, lost decade
  - 1980s US S&L crisis: Real estate lending, bank failures

### Evaluation Criteria
