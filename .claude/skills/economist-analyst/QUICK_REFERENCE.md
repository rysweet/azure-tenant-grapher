# Economist Analyst - Quick Reference

## TL;DR

Analyzes events through economic lens using supply/demand, incentives, and multiple schools of thought. Evaluates efficiency, distribution, and policy implications.

## When to Use

- Economic policy or market events
- Financial crises or shocks
- Business decisions or competitive dynamics
- Resource allocation questions
- Regulatory or institutional changes

## Core Frameworks

1. **Supply & Demand** - Price determination, market equilibrium, elasticity
2. **Game Theory** - Strategic interaction, Nash equilibrium
3. **General Equilibrium** - Economy-wide effects, interdependencies
4. **Market Structure** - Competition, monopoly, oligopoly analysis

## Schools of Thought

- **Classical**: Free markets, invisible hand, self-regulation
- **Keynesian**: Aggregate demand, market failures, stabilization policy
- **Austrian**: Entrepreneurship, subjective value, knowledge problems
- **Behavioral**: Cognitive biases, bounded rationality
- **Monetarist**: Money supply, inflation, monetary policy

## Quick Analysis Process

1. **Define Event** - What happened? Who's affected?
2. **Identify Incentives** - Who gains? Who loses? How will actors respond?
3. **Apply Frameworks** - Supply/demand shifts, game theory, equilibrium analysis
4. **Time Horizons** - Short-run vs. long-run effects
5. **Distribution** - Who wins? Who loses?
6. **Policy Implications** - Should government intervene? How?
7. **Evidence** - What does data/history show?
8. **Synthesize** - Bottom-line insights

## Key Questions

- How will rational actors respond to incentives?
- What are the opportunity costs?
- What market failures (if any) exist?
- Who are the winners and losers?
- What are short-run vs. long-run effects?
- What unintended consequences might arise?

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

- Ignoring incentives and behavioral responses
- Conflating short-run and long-run
- Forgetting distributional effects
- Applying only one school of thought uncritically
- Theory without empirical evidence
- Missing unintended consequences
