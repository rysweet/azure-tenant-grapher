# Economist Analyst Skill

> **Analyze events through the lens of economic theory, frameworks, and evidence to understand market dynamics, incentives, and policy implications.**

## Overview

The Economist Analyst skill enables Claude to perform sophisticated economic analysis of events, policies, and market dynamics. Drawing on multiple schools of economic thought and established analytical frameworks, this skill provides insights into:

- **Market Effects**: Supply, demand, prices, quantities
- **Incentive Structures**: How actors will respond
- **Efficiency**: Resource allocation optimality
- **Distribution**: Winners and losers
- **Policy Implications**: When and how government should intervene
- **Systemic Risks**: Spillovers and unintended consequences

## What Makes This Different

Unlike general analysis, economist analysis:

1. **Focuses on Incentives**: Always asks "How will rational actors respond?"
2. **Applies Rigorous Frameworks**: Supply/demand, game theory, general equilibrium
3. **Considers Multiple Perspectives**: Classical, Keynesian, Austrian, Behavioral schools
4. **Distinguishes Time Horizons**: Short-run vs. long-run effects often differ dramatically
5. **Evidence-Based**: Grounds analysis in data, empirical research, historical precedent
6. **Quantitative When Possible**: Uses elasticities, multipliers, quantitative estimates

## Use Cases

### Market Analysis

- Supply or demand shocks (e.g., oil production disruption)
- Competitive dynamics (e.g., merger evaluation)
- Market structure changes (e.g., new entrant, exit)
- Price movements and quantity adjustments

### Policy Analysis

- Fiscal policy (e.g., tax changes, government spending)
- Monetary policy (e.g., interest rate changes, QE)
- Regulatory changes (e.g., minimum wage, environmental regulations)
- Trade policy (e.g., tariffs, trade agreements)

### Financial Analysis

- Financial crises and credit crunches
- Banking system stability
- Systemic risk assessment
- Monetary transmission mechanisms

### Business Decision Analysis

- Pricing strategies
- Market entry/exit decisions
- Investment evaluations
- Competitive responses

## Economic Frameworks Available

### Core Frameworks

- **Supply and Demand Analysis**: Price determination, equilibrium, elasticity
- **Game Theory**: Strategic interaction, Nash equilibrium, dominant strategies
- **General Equilibrium**: Economy-wide effects, market interdependencies
- **Market Structure Analysis**: Perfect competition, monopoly, oligopoly, monopolistic competition

### Schools of Thought

- **Classical Economics**: Self-regulating markets, invisible hand, division of labor
- **Keynesian Economics**: Aggregate demand, market failures, stabilization policy
- **Austrian Economics**: Entrepreneurship, subjective value, knowledge problems
- **Behavioral Economics**: Cognitive biases, bounded rationality, framing effects
- **Monetarism**: Money supply, inflation, monetary policy primacy
- **Neoclassical Synthesis**: Modern mainstream combining insights from multiple schools

### Methodological Approaches

- Econometric analysis (statistical estimation)
- Comparative analysis (cross-country, time-series, panel data)
- Theoretical modeling (mathematical, simulation, forecasting)
- Natural experiments and quasi-experimental methods
- Case studies and historical analysis

## Quick Start

### Basic Usage

```
Claude, use the economist-analyst skill to analyze [EVENT/POLICY].

Examples:
- "Use economist-analyst to analyze the impact of a 10% increase in interest rates."
- "Analyze the minimum wage increase using the economist-analyst skill."
- "Use the economist skill to evaluate the merger between Company A and Company B."
```

### Advanced Usage

Specify particular frameworks or perspectives:

```
"Use economist-analyst to analyze the oil supply shock using supply/demand analysis and
considering both short-run and long-run effects."

"Apply economist-analyst with Keynesian and Classical perspectives to evaluate the
fiscal stimulus proposal."

"Use economist-analyst with game theory framework to analyze oligopoly pricing behavior."
```

## Analysis Process

The economist analyst follows a systematic 9-step process:

1. **Define Event and Context** - Clarify what's being analyzed, identify relevant markets and actors
2. **Identify Relevant Frameworks** - Select appropriate schools of thought and analytical frameworks
3. **Analyze Incentive Structures** - Map gains/losses, predict behavioral responses
4. **Apply Core Frameworks** - Use supply/demand, game theory, etc.
5. **Consider Time Horizons** - Short-run, medium-run, long-run effects
6. **Assess Distributional Effects** - Who wins, who loses, equity implications
7. **Evaluate Policy Implications** - Market failures, intervention rationale, trade-offs
8. **Ground in Empirical Evidence** - Data, historical precedents, quantitative estimates
9. **Synthesize Insights** - Integrate findings, provide clear conclusions

## Example Analyses

### Example 1: Oil Supply Shock

**Event**: Major oil-producing region reduces production by 10%

**Analysis Highlights**:

- Supply curve shifts left → Sharp price increase (inelastic short-run demand)
- Short-run: Limited adjustment, price spike
- Long-run: Production from other regions, alternatives, behavioral changes
- Winners: Oil producers (unaffected regions), alternatives
- Losers: Consumers, oil-intensive industries, importing countries
- Policy: Strategic reserve release, monetary policy dilemma (stagflation)

### Example 2: Minimum Wage Increase

**Event**: Government increases minimum wage by 20%

**Analysis Highlights**:

- **Classical View**: Labor demand decreases → Unemployment
- **Monopsony Model**: If market power exists, employment may increase
- **Keynesian View**: Demand stimulus from higher wages may offset job losses
- Empirical evidence mixed: Small disemployment effects to minimal impacts
- Trade-off: Equity (higher wages) vs. efficiency (potential unemployment)

### Example 3: Financial Crisis

**Event**: Bank failure triggers runs and credit freeze

**Analysis Highlights**:

- Game theory: Bank run as coordination failure (self-fulfilling)
- Information asymmetry → Credit rationing
- Aggregate demand collapse (Keynesian)
- Systemic risk and externalities
- Policy: Lender of last resort, deposit insurance, bailouts, fiscal stimulus

## Common Questions

### When should I use economist-analyst vs. other analysts?

Use **economist-analyst** when the question involves:

- Market dynamics, prices, quantities
- Incentives and rational behavior
- Efficiency and resource allocation
- Economic policy evaluation
- Distributional effects and who gains/loses
- Financial markets and crises

Use **other analysts** when the focus is:

- Political power and institutions → Political Scientist
- Historical context and precedents → Historian
- Social structures and norms → Sociologist
- Psychological factors → Psychologist/Behavioral Economist

### Can economist analysis be combined with other perspectives?

Absolutely! Economic analysis is particularly powerful when combined with:

- **Political Science**: Adds political economy, institutional analysis
- **History**: Provides long-run context and precedents
- **Sociology**: Adds social structure and culture
- **Psychology**: Deepens behavioral insights

### What if empirical evidence is mixed or limited?

When evidence is unclear:

1. Acknowledge the uncertainty explicitly
2. Present competing theoretical perspectives
3. Identify what additional evidence would help
4. Make conditional statements ("If X, then Y")
5. Focus on general principles and likely directions of effects

### How do I handle disagreements between economic schools?

Different schools offer different insights:

1. Recognize the context determines which is most applicable
2. Synthesize complementary insights where possible
3. Acknowledge where schools genuinely disagree
4. Let empirical evidence guide when available
5. Be transparent about assumptions
