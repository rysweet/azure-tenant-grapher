## Scenario 1: Coalition Government Formation After Hung Parliament

**Event Description**:
A national election produces a hung parliament with no party holding a majority. Results: Center-left party 35%, center-right party 32%, green party 15%, populist party 12%, regional party 6%. The center-left party (largest) has 14 days to form a coalition government or the center-right party gets its turn. Historical context: This country uses proportional representation, coalition governments are common, and policy distance between parties varies significantly. The green party is policy-compatible with center-left but demands cabinet positions and climate policy concessions. The populist party offers support but demands immigration restrictions that alienate the greens. The regional party demands autonomy provisions.

**Analysis Task**:
Analyze the coalition formation dynamics and predict the most likely outcome.

### Expected Analysis Elements

- [ ] **Coalition Theory Application**:
  - Minimum winning coalition (smallest majority possible to maximize payoffs)
  - Ideologically connected coalitions (policy distance matters)
  - Formateur advantage (largest party has first-mover advantage)
  - Office-seeking vs. policy-seeking motivations

- [ ] **Institutional Constraints**:
  - 14-day formation deadline creates time pressure
  - Proportional representation system affects bargaining
  - Cabinet formation rules and norms
  - Investiture vote requirements

- [ ] **Power Dynamics**:
  - Pivotal party analysis (which party is kingmaker?)
  - Coalition arithmetic: Multiple viable combinations (35+15=50%, 35+12=47%, 32+15+6=53%)
  - Bargaining power: Green party is pivotal for center-left
  - Outside options and BATNA (Best Alternative To Negotiated Agreement)

- [ ] **Policy Space Analysis**:
  - Spatial modeling: Policy positions on economic and social dimensions
  - Center-left + Green = ideologically connected, minimal policy distance
  - Center-left + Populist = ideologically distant, high transaction costs
  - Grand coalition (center-left + center-right) = centrist but wastes seats

- [ ] **Strategic Considerations**:
  - Future electoral consequences of coalition choices
  - Blame avoidance vs. credit claiming
  - Coalition stability and durability
  - Commitment problems and credible promises

- [ ] **Historical Precedents**:
  - Similar coalition formations in this country
  - Comparative cases (Germany, Netherlands, Belgium)
  - Durability patterns of different coalition types
  - Lessons from minority government attempts

### Evaluation Criteria

- **Domain Accuracy** (0-10): Correct application of coalition theory, spatial models, institutional analysis
- **Analytical Depth** (0-10): Thoroughness of power dynamics, policy space, strategic analysis
- **Insight Specificity** (0-10): Clear prediction with probabilistic reasoning
- **Historical Grounding** (0-10): References to comparative cases, precedents
- **Reasoning Clarity** (0-10): Logical flow from theory to evidence to predictions

**Minimum Passing Score**: 35/50

## Scenario 2: Democratic Backsliding in Hybrid Regime

**Event Description**:
A democratically elected government in a hybrid regime (semi-democratic, semi-authoritarian) begins systematic erosion of democratic institutions over 3 years. Actions include: stacking the constitutional court with loyalists, criminalizing opposition media as "foreign agents," gerrymandering electoral districts, restricting NGO activities, weakening legislative oversight, and using state resources for partisan advantage. The government maintains 55% approval ratings due to strong economic growth and nationalist rhetoric. International observers downgrade the country's democracy rating from "free" to "partly free." Opposition parties are fragmented, civil society is weak, and the military remains neutral but loyal to the constitution.

**Analysis Task**:
Analyze the democratic backsliding dynamics and assess the regime's trajectory.

### Expected Analysis Elements

  - Point of no return analysis

- [ ] **Institutional Analysis**:
  - Horizontal accountability breakdown (courts, legislature compromised)
  - Vertical accountability stress (media restrictions, electoral manipulation)
  - Checks and balances erosion
  - Constitutional safeguards vs. majoritarian abuse

- [ ] **Political Economy**:
  - Rentier state dynamics (if applicable)
  - Economic performance legitimacy (55% approval from growth)
  - Distributional coalitions supporting regime
  - Elite incentives and coordination

- [ ] **Civil Society and Opposition**:
  - Opposition fragmentation enables executive dominance
  - Collective action problems for civil society
  - Preference falsification and spiral of silence
  - Tipping point dynamics for mass mobilization

- [ ] **International Dimension**:

## Scenario 3: Social Movement Mobilization and Policy Change

**Event Description**:
A social movement emerges demanding police reform after a series of high-profile incidents of police violence. The movement employs diverse tactics: peaceful protests (hundreds of thousands in major cities), civil disobedience, social media campaigns (#ReformPolice trending), electoral mobilization (targeting incumbents), and legislative lobbying. Counter-mobilization occurs with pro-police groups. Public opinion shifts from 35% support for major reform (before incidents) to 58% support (after 6 months of activism). The ruling party faces internal divisions: progressive wing supports reform, moderate wing fears alienating police unions and suburban voters. Municipal governments begin implementing modest reforms, but national legislation stalls in parliament. Movement leaders debate whether to accept incremental change or hold out for comprehensive reform.

**Analysis Task**:
Analyze the movement's prospects for achieving policy change and provide strategic recommendations.

### Expected Analysis Elements

- [ ] **Social Movement Theory**:
  - Resource mobilization: Organizational capacity, funding, networks
  - Political opportunity structure: Electoral vulnerability, elite divisions, public opinion shifts
  - Framing: Issue framing as justice vs. public safety, resonance with broader values
  - Tactical repertoire: Protests, civil disobedience, electoral, legislative strategies

- [ ] **Power and Influence**:
  - Inside vs. outside strategies (lobbying vs. protest)
  - Disruption power vs. electoral threat
  - Coalition building with sympathetic elites
  - Media attention and agenda-setting

- [ ] **Political Context**:
  - Electoral cycle (upcoming elections create pressure)
  - Partisan polarization (bipartisan support needed?)
  - Federalism: Municipal vs. state vs. national reform
  - Veto points in legislative process

- [ ] **Policy Change Dynamics**:
  - Window of opportunity (crisis-driven attention)
  - Policy feedback effects (incremental reforms create constituencies)
  - Path dependence and institutional stickiness
  - Implementation challenges (bureaucratic resistance, police unions)

- [ ] **Strategic Dilemmas**:
  - Radical flank effect: Do disruptive tactics help or hurt?
  - Incremental vs. comprehensive change trade-off
  - Institutionalization vs. grassroots energy
  - Coalition maintenance vs. ideological purity

- [ ] **Historical Precedents**:
  - Civil rights movement (1960s US)
  - Anti-apartheid movement (South Africa)
  - Recent movements: Marriage equality, climate activism
  - Lessons: Successful paths to policy change, common failures

### Evaluation Criteria

- **Domain Accuracy** (0-10): Correct application of social movement theory, policy change frameworks
- **Analytical Depth** (0-10): Thoroughness of power dynamics, strategic analysis
- **Insight Specificity** (0-10): Clear strategic recommendations grounded in theory
- **Historical Grounding** (0-10): References to comparative movements, empirical patterns

## Scenario 4: Ethnic Conflict and Power-Sharing Negotiations

**Event Description**:
A multi-ethnic state with a history of inter-communal violence (last major episode 15 years ago) faces renewed tensions. Demographics: Majority Group A (55%), Minority Group B (30%), Minority Group C (15%). Triggering events: Group A-dominated government proposes citizenship law perceived as discriminatory by Group B; Group B leaders call for boycott and autonomy; Group C fears being caught in crossfire. Low-level violence erupts: riots, property destruction, 50 deaths. International mediators propose power-sharing agreement with provisions for: proportional representation in legislature, consociational executive (rotating presidency or grand coalition cabinet), minority veto on sensitive issues, territorial autonomy for Group B regions, and truth and reconciliation commission. Group A hardliners resist ("majority rule, why should we compromise?"), Group B demands federalism and explicit constitutional recognition, Group C wants guarantees of protection.

## Scenario 5: Populist Party Electoral Breakthrough and Governing Challenge

**Event Description**:
A populist outsider party wins 38% in national elections, forming a minority government with confidence-and-supply support from a smaller party. The populist party's platform: anti-establishment rhetoric, nationalism, protectionism, skepticism of international institutions, direct democracy proposals (frequent referendums), and anti-corruption crusade. Leadership style: charismatic leader with social media prowess, attacks on "elite media," and confrontational approach to institutions. Governing challenges emerge: Bureaucracy resists policy implementation; constitutional court blocks several initiatives as unconstitutional; diplomatic tensions with allies over foreign policy; economic uncertainty from protectionist policies; media scrutiny intensifies; approval ratings decline from 45% (honeymoon) to 35% (6 months in).
