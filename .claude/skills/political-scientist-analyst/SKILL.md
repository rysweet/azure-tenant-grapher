# Political Scientist Analyst Skill

## Purpose

Analyze events through the disciplinary lens of political science, applying established theoretical frameworks (Realism, Liberalism, Constructivism), comparative political analysis, institutional analysis, and rigorous methodological approaches to understand power dynamics, governance structures, actor interests, strategic interactions, and policy outcomes.

## When to Use This Skill

- **International Relations Analysis**: Wars, alliances, treaties, international crises, great power competition
- **Regime Analysis**: Democratization, democratic backsliding, authoritarian resilience, transitions
- **Electoral Analysis**: Election outcomes, voting behavior, party systems, electoral institutions
- **Policy Analysis**: Domestic and foreign policy decisions, policy implementation, policy outcomes
- **Institutional Analysis**: Constitutional design, institutional reform, checks and balances, governance
- **Conflict Analysis**: Interstate and intrastate conflicts, civil wars, ethnic conflicts, peace processes
- **International Organization Analysis**: UN, NATO, EU, WTO effectiveness and dynamics

## Core Philosophy: Political Analysis

Political science analysis rests on several fundamental principles:

**Power Matters**: Politics is fundamentally about power—who has it, how it's distributed, how it's exercised, and how it shapes outcomes.

**Institutions Structure Politics**: Formal and informal rules shape political behavior, constrain actors, and produce systematic outcomes.

**Interests Drive Behavior**: Actors (states, leaders, groups) pursue their interests, though those interests may be material, ideational, or socially constructed.

**Context Is Critical**: Historical, cultural, and structural context profoundly shapes political processes and outcomes.

**Multiple Levels of Analysis**: Political phenomena operate simultaneously at individual, domestic, interstate, and systemic levels.

**Comparative Perspective**: Comparing across countries, regions, and time periods reveals patterns and causal relationships.

**Causal Mechanisms Matter**: Understanding HOW and WHY outcomes occur, not just THAT they occur, is central to political analysis.

## Theoretical Foundations (Expandable)

### Framework 1: Realism and Structural Realism

**Core Principles**:

- States are primary actors in international politics
- International system is anarchic (no overarching authority)
- States pursue power and security to ensure survival
- Self-help system where states must rely on themselves
- Balance of power is key stabilizing mechanism
- Security and material power drive state behavior

**Classical Realism (Morgenthau)**:

- Human nature (desire for power) drives politics
- National interest defined in terms of power
- Moral principles cannot determine state action
- Balance of power prevents hegemony

**Structural Realism/Neorealism (Waltz)**:

- System structure (anarchy, distribution of power) determines outcomes
- States are functionally similar (all seek survival)
- Bipolarity more stable than multipolarity
- Structure shapes, not determines, behavior

**Key Insights**:

- "Realism continues to emphasize the centrality of power and security in an anarchic international system, offering insights into state-centric responses to threats and the resurgence of geopolitical rivalries" (2025)
- Security dilemmas: Actions to increase security can decrease others' security
- Relative gains matter more than absolute gains
- Cooperation is difficult but not impossible

**Founding Thinker**: **Hans Morgenthau** (1904-1980)

- Key Work: _Politics Among Nations_ (1948)
- Core concept: "Interest defined in terms of power"
- Contributions: Realist theory, national interest, balance of power

**Structural Realist**: **Kenneth Waltz** (1924-2013)

- Key Work: _Theory of International Politics_ (1979)
- Innovation: System-level (structural) theory
- Focus: Anarchy and distribution of capabilities shape outcomes

**When to Apply**:

- Interstate conflicts and wars
- Great power competition (e.g., US-China)
- Alliance formation and balance of power
- Security dilemmas
- Arms races
- Territorial disputes

### Framework 2: Liberalism and Neoliberal Institutionalism

**Core Principles**:

- Economic interdependence reduces conflict
- International institutions facilitate cooperation
- Domestic factors (regime type, interest groups, public opinion) matter
- Democratic peace: democracies rarely fight each other
- Complex interdependence characterizes modern IR
- Absolute gains matter (not just relative gains)
- Cooperation possible even in anarchy

**Key Insights**:

- "Highlights the potential for collective action and rule-based order"
- Institutions provide information, reduce transaction costs, facilitate monitoring
- Trade creates interdependence and shared interests
- Democracy and liberalism promote peace
- Non-state actors (NGOs, MNCs) play important roles

**Key Thinker**: **Robert Keohane**

- Key Work: _International Institutions and State Power_ (1989)
- Innovation: Shows cooperation possible through institutions even in anarchy
- With Joseph Nye: "Complex interdependence" concept
- Uses game theory to demonstrate cooperation serves self-interest

**When to Apply**:

- International organizations (UN, WTO, IMF)
- Trade agreements and economic integration
- European integration
- Global governance
- Multilateral cooperation on climate, health, etc.
- Democratic transitions and consolidation

- [Introducing Major IR Theories - E-IR](https://www.e-ir.info/2024/12/29/introducing-the-major-international-relations-theories/)

### Framework 3: Constructivism

**Core Principles**:

- Ideas, norms, and identities shape politics
- Reality is socially constructed through shared understandings
- State interests are not fixed but malleable
- Discourse and communication matter
- Culture and social factors shape politics
- Change possible through ideational shifts
- Norms evolve and diffuse

**Key Insights**:

- "Emphasizing the role of ideas, norms, and identities, provides a dynamic perspective on how global challenges reshape state interests and international norms"
- Explains norm diffusion (human rights, sovereignty norms, environmental norms)
- Identity politics and nationalism
- How ideas become institutionalized
- Socialization and norm entrepreneurs

**When to Apply**:

- Understanding norm diffusion (e.g., human rights, R2P)
- Identity conflicts and nationalism
- Evaluating impact of rhetoric and discourse
- Explaining changes in state preferences
- Transnational advocacy networks
- Cultural and civilizational factors

### Framework 4: Comparative Politics and Institutions

**Overview**:
"Field characterized by the use of the comparative method or other empirical methods to explore politics both within and between countries"

**Key Questions**:

- Why do some countries democratize while others remain authoritarian?
- How do electoral systems affect party systems?
- What explains variation in economic development?
- How do institutions shape policy outcomes?
- What causes civil wars and ethnic conflicts?

**Five Main Approaches**:

1. **Institutional Analysis**: How institutions shape outcomes
2. **Interest Approach**: Role of interest groups and collective action
3. **Ideas Approach**: Impact of ideology and beliefs
4. **Individual Approach**: Micro-level political behavior
5. **International Environment**: Global factors shaping domestic politics

**Institutional Focus**:

- **Definition**: "The set of formal rules and laws (including constitutions) as well as the informal rules, norms, mores, and etiquette"
- **Types**: Presidential vs. parliamentary, electoral systems, federal vs. unitary, strong vs. weak legislatures
- **Effects**: Institutions structure competition, shape policy, distribute power

**Democracy vs. Authoritarianism**:

- **Democracy**: Free elections, civil liberties, rule of law, accountability
- **Authoritarianism**: Limited competition, restricted liberties, concentrated power
- **Hybrid Regimes**: "Authoritarian regimes increasingly attempting to use 'democratic' institutions to prolong their rule"
- **Contemporary Trend**: "Concurrent resurgence of authoritarianism" with "sophisticated techniques such as surveillance technology and media manipulation"

**When to Apply**:

- Comparing political systems
- Analyzing regime transitions
- Evaluating institutional reforms
- Understanding electoral outcomes
- Explaining policy variation
- Assessing governance quality

## Core Analytical Frameworks (Expandable)

### Framework 1: Levels of Analysis

**Purpose**: Organize analysis by distinguishing different analytical levels

**Four Levels**:

1. **Individual Level**
   - Focus: Leaders, decision-makers, individuals
   - Factors: Personality, beliefs, psychology, cognitive biases
   - Example: How did leader's beliefs shape foreign policy?

2. **Domestic/State Level**
   - Focus: Regime type, institutions, domestic politics, interest groups, public opinion
   - Factors: Democratic vs. authoritarian, electoral systems, coalitions, bureaucracies
   - Example: How do domestic politics constrain foreign policy?

3. **Interstate Level**
   - Focus: Relations between states, alliances, rivalries, diplomacy
   - Factors: Bilateral relationships, regional dynamics, alliance structures
   - Example: How do alliance commitments shape behavior?

4. **Systemic Level**
   - Focus: Structure of international system
   - Factors: Distribution of power (unipolar, bipolar, multipolar), international norms, global institutions
   - Example: How does polarity affect stability?

**Analytical Value**:

- Clarifies what is being explained and at what level
- Reveals different causal mechanisms
- Avoids conflating levels (e.g., system-level outcomes vs. state-level decisions)

### Framework 2: Power Analysis

**Types of Power**:

1. **Hard Power**
   - Military capabilities (force or threat of force)
   - Economic coercion (sanctions, aid conditionality)
   - Tangible resources

2. **Soft Power**
   - Attraction and persuasion
   - Cultural influence
   - Legitimacy and moral authority
   - Agenda-setting

3. **Structural Power**
   - Shape rules and institutions
   - Define what is normal or acceptable
   - Control over frameworks of interaction

**Power Distribution**:

- **Unipolar**: One dominant power (e.g., US post-Cold War)
- **Bipolar**: Two great powers (e.g., US-USSR Cold War)
- **Multipolar**: Multiple great powers (e.g., pre-WWI Europe)
- **Implications**: Different distributions create different dynamics (stability, conflict likelihood)

**Power Resources vs. Power Outcomes**:

- Resources don't automatically translate to outcomes
- Context matters: asymmetric interdependence, resolve, strategy
- Power is relational, not absolute

### Framework 3: Strategic Interaction and Game Theory

**Purpose**: Analyze situations where outcomes depend on multiple actors' choices

**Key Concepts**:

- **Players**: Actors making strategic choices
- **Strategies**: Available actions
- **Payoffs**: Outcomes for each combination of strategies
- **Equilibrium**: Stable outcome where no player wants to unilaterally change strategy

**Classic Games in Politics**:

1. **Prisoner's Dilemma**
   - Structure: Individual rationality leads to collectively suboptimal outcome
   - Politics: Arms races, trade wars, free-riding in alliances
   - Solution: Iteration, communication, institutions

2. **Chicken/Brinkmanship**
   - Structure: Mutually destructive outcome if both choose aggressive strategy
   - Politics: Nuclear crises, territorial standoffs
   - Dynamics: Commitment, credibility, signaling

3. **Stag Hunt/Coordination**
   - Structure: Multiple equilibria, need to coordinate
   - Politics: Institution-building, norm formation
   - Challenge: Reaching Pareto-superior equilibrium

**Applications**:

- Interstate bargaining
- Alliance formation
- Crisis behavior
- Legislative politics
- Coalition formation

### Framework 4: Process Tracing

**Definition**: "Research method for studying how causal processes work using case study methods"

**Purpose**: "Uncovering the process by which events unfolded"

**Approach**:

- Trace causal mechanisms step-by-step
- Identify observable implications of hypothesized causes
- Test whether evidence matches predictions
- Rule out alternative explanations

**Strength**: Understanding HOW and WHY, not just THAT

**Applications**:

- Explaining specific historical events
- Testing causal theories
- Understanding decision-making processes
- Tracing diffusion of norms or policies

**Sources**:

- [Case Studies and Process Tracing - Vennesson](https://minorthesis.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/vennesson-case-study-methods.pdf)

### Framework 5: Comparative Method

**Purpose**: Systematic comparison to identify causal relationships

**Designs**:

1. **Most Similar Systems Design**
   - Compare similar cases that differ in outcome
   - Control for many factors, isolate key difference
   - Example: Why did democracy consolidate in Country A but not B (similar contexts)?

2. **Most Different Systems Design**
   - Compare dissimilar cases with same outcome
   - If same outcome despite different contexts, identify common cause
   - Example: Successful democratization in very different countries—what's common?

3. **Within-Case Comparison**
   - Compare across time periods or regions within a case
   - Before/after institutional change
   - Regional variation within country

**Strengths**:

- Identify necessary and sufficient conditions
- Test rival hypotheses
- Establish causal relationships

**Limitations**:

- Small-N problem
- Selection bias
- Omitted variables

## Step-by-Step Analysis Process

### Step 1: Define Event and Context

**Actions**:

- Clearly state what event is being analyzed
- Identify relevant actors (states, leaders, groups, organizations)
- Establish timeline and key developments
- Determine scope (domestic, regional, international)
- Identify what type of political event (conflict, election, reform, crisis, etc.)

**Outputs**:

- Event description
- Key actors identified
- Timeline established
- Context documented

### Step 2: Determine Level(s) of Analysis

**Actions**:

- Decide which level(s) are most relevant: individual, domestic, interstate, systemic
- Identify whether multiple levels interact
- Clarify what is being explained (state behavior, system outcome, policy choice, etc.)

**Reasoning**:

- Leader decision → Individual level
- Domestic regime change → Domestic level
- Interstate war → Interstate and/or systemic level
- Often multiple levels matter

**Outputs**:

- Primary level(s) identified
- Cross-level dynamics noted

### Step 3: Select Relevant Theoretical Frameworks

**Actions**:

- Determine which theories apply

## Usage Examples

### Example 1: International Crisis - Alliance Invocation During Border Conflict

**Event**: Country A invades border territory of Country B. Country B invokes mutual defense treaty with Country C. Country C must decide whether to honor commitment.

**Analysis Approach**:

**Step 1 - Context**:

- Event: Potential military conflict escalation through alliance
- Actors: Country A (aggressor), Country B (victim), Country C (ally)
- Timeline: Invasion → Treaty invocation → Decision point for Country C
- Scope: Interstate, potential for regional/systemic implications

**Step 2 - Level of Analysis**:

- Primary: Interstate (alliance politics)
- Secondary: Domestic (Country C's internal debates about honoring commitment)
- Systemic: How does response affect broader alliance credibility?

**Step 3 - Theoretical Frameworks**:

- **Realism**: Alliance credibility, balance of power, security concerns
- **Liberalism**: Institutional commitments, reputation costs
- **Constructivism**: Norms of alliance solidarity, identity as reliable ally

**Step 4 - Power Analysis**:

- Country A: Regional power, military advantage over B
- Country B: Weaker militarily, but has alliance
- Country C: Great power, capability to deter A, but costs of intervention
- Power dynamics: A likely calculated B's allies wouldn't respond; C's response changes calculus

**Step 5 - Institutional Analysis**:

- Institution: Mutual defense treaty
- Formal rule: Attack on one is attack on all
- Institutional credibility at stake
- Historical precedents: NATO Article 5, historical alliance commitments

**Step 6 - Actor Interests and Strategies**:

- **Country A's interests**: Territory, testing alliance resolve, regional dominance
- **Country A's strategy**: Calculated aggression, fait accompli
- **Country B's interests**: Territorial integrity, security, alliance value
- **Country B's strategy**: Invoke alliance, internationalize conflict
- **Country C's interests**: Alliance credibility, regional stability vs. costs of war
- **Country C's strategy**: Face dilemma—honor commitment (costly) or defect (reputation costs)

**Step 7 - Comparative Perspective**:

- Historical cases: WWI (alliance chains), 1930s (failed commitments)
- NATO Article 5 invocations (9/11 - honored)
- Cases where alliances weren't honored (lessons on credibility loss)

**Step 8 - Causal Mechanisms**:

- **Realist mechanism**: If C defects, A emboldened, B abandoned, alliance system weakens → Future aggression more likely
- **Institutionalist mechanism**: Honoring commitments reinforces institution, creates reputation for reliability
- **Constructivist mechanism**: Invoking identity as "reliable ally" constrains behavior

**Step 9 - Historical Context**:

- Pre-WWI: Alliance chains escalated regional conflict
- 1930s appeasement: Failed deterrence invited aggression
- Cold War: Credible commitments prevented conflicts
- Post-Cold War: Selective enforcement of commitments

**Step 10 - Implications**:

- **Security**: If C intervenes → Deters A, protects B, maintains alliance. If C defects → A wins, alliances lose credibility
- **Systemic**: Affects all alliance commitments globally
- **Normative**: Legitimacy of aggression vs. alliance obligations

**Step 11 - Synthesis**:

- **Realist view**: C must respond to maintain credibility and balance power
- **Liberal view**: Institutional commitment and reputation costs require response
- **Constructivist view**: Identity as reliable ally shapes appropriate behavior
- **Comparative lessons**: Failure to honor commitments historically invites further aggression
- **Conclusion**: Multiple theoretical perspectives and historical lessons suggest C should honor commitment, though costs are real
- **Uncertainty**: Outcome depends on domestic politics in C, assessment of risks, and signaling

### Example 2: Regime Transition - Authoritarian Breakdown and Democratization

**Event**: Long-standing authoritarian regime faces protests, economic crisis, and elite defections. Regime collapses. Country faces uncertain transition.

**Analysis Approach**:

**Step 1 - Context**:

- Event: Regime collapse and potential democratization
- Actors: Outgoing authoritarian elite, opposition groups, military, civil society, international actors
- Timeline: Protests → Economic crisis → Elite splits → Regime collapse → Transition period
- Scope: Domestic, with international dimensions

**Step 2 - Level of Analysis**:

- Primary: Domestic (regime dynamics, transition politics)
- Secondary: Societal (protest movements, civil society)
- Systemic: International diffusion effects, external support

**Step 3 - Theoretical Frameworks**:

- **Democratization theories**: Transitions literature (O'Donnell, Schmitter, Linz)
- **Institutional analysis**: Role of institutions in shaping transition
- **Comparative politics**: Democracy vs. authoritarianism dynamics

**Step 4 - Power Analysis**:

- Outgoing regime: Losing power, but retains coercive apparatus
- Opposition: Growing power through mobilization, but fragmented
- Military: Pivotal actor—can prop up regime or facilitate transition
- International actors: Leverage through aid, sanctions, recognition

**Step 5 - Institutional Analysis**:

- **Authoritarian institutions**: Weak, losing legitimacy
- **Informal institutions**: Patronage networks, coercion
- **Missing institutions**: Democratic institutions must be built
- **Transitional institutions**: Constitutional assemblies, interim governments

**Step 6 - Actor Interests and Strategies**:

- **Outgoing elite**: Preserve wealth and security, avoid prosecution
- **Hardliners vs. Softliners**: Split within elite—fight vs. negotiate
- **Opposition**: Democracy, but also power and policy goals
- **Military**: Autonomy, corporate interests, fear of retribution
- **Strategies**: Negotiations, pacts, constitution-making, transitional justice

**Step 7 - Comparative Perspective**:

- **Successful transitions**: Spain (1970s), South Korea (1980s), Eastern Europe (1990s)
- **Failed transitions**: Arab Spring cases, Venezuela
- **Lessons**: Pacted transitions more stable; polarization risks; timing of elections matters

**Step 8 - Causal Mechanisms**:

- **Economic crisis → Regime weakness**: Resource constraints reduce patronage, coercion
- **Elite defection → Regime collapse**: Once elite splits, regime vulnerable
- **Pacts → Transition success**: Negotiated agreements reduce uncertainty, facilitate cooperation

**Step 9 - Historical Context**:

- Third Wave democratization (1974-1991): Many transitions, varied outcomes
- Recent wave of authoritarianism (2000s-2020s): Democratic backsliding
- Path dependence: Prior regime type affects transition prospects

**Step 10 - Implications**:

- **Democracy prospects**: Depends on elite pacts, institutional design, civil society strength, economic conditions
- **Stability risks**: Polarization, violence, authoritarian reversion
- **Policy options**: Constitutional design (presidential vs. parliamentary), electoral system, transitional justice, international support

**Step 11 - Synthesis**:

- Comparative evidence: Pacted transitions with elite guarantees more successful
- Military's role critical: If sides with democracy, transition likely succeeds
- Timing matters: Premature elections risk polarization; delayed elections risk authoritarian reversion
- International support can help consolidation
- Uncertainty: Many transitions fail; initial conditions and choices matter greatly

### Example 3: International Institution Analysis - Climate Agreement Negotiations

**Event**: Countries negotiate binding international climate agreement. Disagreements over emissions targets, financing, and enforcement.

**Analysis Approach**:

**Step 1 - Context**:

- Event: Multilateral climate negotiations
- Actors: Developed countries, emerging economies (China, India, Brazil), developing countries, EU
- Scope: Global governance, international institution-building
- Challenge: Collective action problem with distributional conflicts

**Step 2 - Level of Analysis**:

- Primary: Interstate (negotiation dynamics)
- Secondary: Domestic (domestic politics constrain positions)
- Systemic: Global public goods provision

**Step 3 - Theoretical Frameworks**:

- **Liberalism/Institutionalism**: Conditions for cooperation, role of institutions
- **Realism**: Relative gains concerns, sovereignty, enforcement problems
- **Constructivism**: Norm diffusion, climate justice frames

**Step 4 - Power Analysis**:

- **Great power dynamics**: US, China, EU have most leverage
- **Coalition power**: G77 developing countries coalition
- **Economic power**: Developed countries have resources, but emerging economies are major emitters
- **Moral authority**: Small island states vulnerable to climate change

**Step 5 - Institutional Analysis**:

- **Existing institutions**: UNFCCC framework, Kyoto Protocol precedent
- **Institutional challenges**: Enforcement, verification, compliance
- **Institutional innovations**: Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs), Green Climate Fund

**Step 6 - Actor Interests and Strategies**:

- **Developed countries**: Cap emissions globally, but resist binding targets and financial obligations
- **Emerging economies**: Right to development, common but differentiated responsibilities
- **Developing countries**: Financing, adaptation support, loss and damage compensation
- **Strategies**: Coalition-building, issue linkage, shaming

**Step 7 - Comparative Perspective**:

- **Successful regimes**: Montreal Protocol (ozone), Antarctica Treaty
- **Lessons**: Side payments facilitate cooperation; clear science helps; verification matters
- **Failed cases**: Kyoto Protocol (US didn't ratify, limited coverage)

**Step 8 - Causal Mechanisms**:

- **Collective action problem**: Each state incentive to free-ride
- **Distributive conflict**: Who bears costs? Who pays?
- **Institutional solutions**: Transparency, targets, financing

**Step 9 - Historical Context**:

- Rio Earth Summit (1992): Framework established
- Kyoto Protocol (1997): Binding targets for developed countries
- Paris Agreement (2015): NDCs approach
- Evolving norms: Climate action increasingly accepted

**Step 10 - Implications**:

- **Success factors**: Binding yet flexible, adequate financing, transparency, ratcheting ambition
- **Failure risks**: Free-riding, non-compliance, insufficient ambition
- **Governance**: Shift from top-down to bottom-up (NDCs)
- **Justice**: Developed countries' historical responsibility vs. emerging economies' current emissions

**Step 11 - Synthesis**:

- **Liberal institutionalist view**: Institutions can facilitate cooperation even with conflicting interests—transparency, iterated interaction, issue linkage
- **Realist skepticism**: Sovereignty concerns, enforcement problems, relative gains worries limit effectiveness
- **Constructivist insight**: Norm diffusion and climate justice discourse shape state positions
- **Comparative lessons**: Side payments (Green Climate Fund) and verification enhance cooperation
- **Conclusion**: Agreement possible but requires credible commitments, adequate financing, and ongoing ratcheting of ambition
- **Challenge**: Enforcement remains weak; depends on domestic politics and norm internalization

## Common Pitfalls to Avoid

**Pitfall 1: Conflating Levels of Analysis**

- **Problem**: Mixing individual-level explanations with system-level outcomes
- **Solution**: Clearly specify level of analysis; distinguish causes at different levels

**Pitfall 2: Applying One Theory Uncritically**

- **Problem**: Using only realism or only liberalism without considering alternatives
- **Solution**: Apply multiple theories; recognize each offers partial insights

**Pitfall 3: Ignoring Domestic Politics**

- **Problem**: Treating states as unitary actors when domestic politics matters
- **Solution**: Use two-level game framework; consider regime type, coalitions, public opinion

**Pitfall 4: Atheoretical Analysis**

- **Problem**: Descriptive narrative without theoretical framework
- **Solution**: Explicitly state theoretical perspective; derive testable implications

**Pitfall 5: Cherry-Picking Historical Cases**

- **Problem**: Selecting only cases supporting preferred interpretation
- **Solution**: Systematic case selection; address contradictory evidence

**Pitfall 6: Ignoring Strategic Interaction**

- **Problem**: Analyzing actors in isolation without considering interdependence
- **Solution**: Use game theory or strategic interaction framework

**Pitfall 7: Deterministic Claims**

- **Problem**: Asserting outcomes are inevitable
- **Solution**: Acknowledge contingency, uncertainty, and alternative scenarios

**Pitfall 8: Presentism**

- **Problem**: Judging past events by contemporary standards without historical context
- **Solution**: Understand historical context; avoid anachronistic judgments
