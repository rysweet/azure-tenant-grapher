# Journalist Analyst Skill

## Purpose

Analyze events through the disciplinary lens of journalism, applying established reporting frameworks (5 Ws and H, inverted pyramid), investigative methods, source evaluation techniques, and ethical journalism principles to understand what happened, verify facts, identify information gaps, assess newsworthiness, and evaluate how stories are told.

## When to Use This Skill

- **Breaking News Analysis**: Rapidly assessing developing events for facts and significance
- **Fact-Checking**: Verifying claims, identifying misinformation, evaluating evidence
- **Source Evaluation**: Assessing credibility and reliability of information sources
- **Story Development**: Identifying angles, leads, and information gaps
- **Media Criticism**: Analyzing how news is framed, what's emphasized or omitted
- **Crisis Communication**: Understanding information flow and public perception
- **Investigative Analysis**: Uncovering hidden connections, following money/power

## Core Philosophy: Journalistic Thinking

Journalistic analysis rests on fundamental principles:

**Facts Are Sacred**: Accuracy is paramount. Verify before publishing. Correct errors promptly.

**Show Your Work**: Transparency about sources, methods, and limitations builds trust.

**Follow the Story Wherever It Leads**: Report truth even when inconvenient, uncomfortable, or contradicts expectations.

**Serve the Public Interest**: Journalism's duty is to inform citizens, hold power accountable, give voice to voiceless.

**Question Everything**: Healthy skepticism toward all sources, especially those in power. Trust but verify.

**Context Matters**: Facts without context can mislead. Provide background, perspective, proportion.

**Be Fair and Balanced**: Present multiple perspectives. Distinguish reporting from opinion. Minimize harm.

### Framework 2: Inverted Pyramid Structure

**Origin**: American journalism, 19th century (Civil War era)

**Core Principle**: Most important information first, details in descending order of importance

**Structure**:

- **Lead (Lede)**: Most newsworthy facts (who, what, when, where, why, how)
- **Body**: Supporting details, context, quotes, in decreasing importance
- **Tail**: Background, less essential information

**Rationale**:

- Readers may stop reading at any point—ensure they get essentials first
- Editors can cut from bottom without losing key facts
- Busy readers get core information quickly

**Key Insights**:

- Forces prioritization (what matters most?)
- Front-loads verification (most important claims get most scrutiny)
- Clarity and efficiency

**Modern Variations**:

- **Hourglass**: Inverted pyramid top, narrative middle, conclusion
- **Kabob**: Multiple inverted pyramids (breaking news updates)
- **Nut graf**: After lead, paragraph explaining significance

**When to Apply**: Breaking news, straightforward reporting, time-sensitive information

**Source**: [Inverted Pyramid - Wikipedia](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inverted_pyramid_(journalism)>)

### Framework 3: Newsworthiness Criteria

- Where else has this happened?
- Why is this happening now?
- How do we know this is true?
- What's the other side's view?
- What happens next?

**When to Apply**: Initial assessment of any event or story

### Framework 5: Framing and Emphasis

- When did company executives know?
- When did whistleblower come forward?
- When did journalists begin investigating?
- When were users affected?
- When did regulators learn?
- What's the timeline for legal action?

**Step 10 - Synthesis**:
**What We Know** (if verified):

- Company collected data beyond disclosed practices
- X million users affected
- Practice occurred from DATE to DATE
- Internal documents confirm knowledge by executives
- Violates privacy policies and potentially laws

**What Needs Further Investigation**:

- Full scope of data collection
- What was done with data
- Whether data was sold
- Who specifically is responsible
- What other products are affected
- What regulators will do

**Recommended Investigation Path**:

1. Secure documentary evidence
2. Interview whistleblowers (protect identity)
3. Consult independent experts for technical verification
4. Interview current/former employees
5. Present findings to company for response
6. Engage legal review before publication
7. Prepare comprehensive investigative piece
8. Follow up with ongoing coverage of legal/regulatory response

**Story Approach**:

- Lead with strongest verified facts
- Use specific examples (anonymized if needed) to humanize impact
- Present documentary evidence
- Include company response prominently (fairness)
- Provide technical explanation for general audience
- Explain legal and regulatory implications
- Give users actionable advice
- Commit to follow-up coverage

### Example 3: Media Criticism - Analyzing Biased Coverage

**Event**: Two news outlets cover same protest very differently. Analyze the differences and identify bias.

**Analysis**:

**Step 1 - Basic Facts (from primary sources, not media)**:

- Protest occurred at X location
- Y number of participants (police estimate, organizer estimate differ)
- Duration: Z hours
- No arrests, or N arrests (verify via police records)
- Cause: Specific policy issue
- Outcomes: Meeting arranged? Policy change? Nothing?

**Step 2 - Comparative Coverage Analysis**:

**Outlet A Coverage**:

- **Headline**: "Violent Protesters Disrupt Downtown"
- **Lead**: Emphasizes traffic disruption, business impact
- **Sources**: Business owners, police, city officials
- **Language**: "Mob," "chaos," "agitators"
- **Images**: Isolated confrontation, property damage
- **Context**: Minimal about protest cause
- **Omissions**: Protest organizers' voices, larger peaceful majority

**Outlet B Coverage**:

- **Headline**: "Thousands Rally for Policy Change"
- **Lead**: Emphasizes turnout, message, energy
- **Sources**: Organizers, participants, sympathetic officials
- **Language**: "Activists," "passionate," "demonstrators"
- **Images**: Crowd shots, signs, diverse participants
- **Context**: Detailed explanation of grievances
- **Omissions**: Disruption caused, business concerns, tensions

**Step 3 - Bias Identification**:

**Outlet A Biases**:

- **Framing**: Protest as problem, not expression
- **Source selection**: Anti-protest voices only
- **Language**: Pejorative terms
- **Emphasis**: Negative aspects (disruption, not message)
- **Omissions**: Protest rationale, peaceful majority
- **Pattern**: Delegitimizes protest

**Outlet B Biases**:

- **Framing**: Protest as noble cause
- **Source selection**: Pro-protest voices only
- **Language**: Sympathetic terms
- **Emphasis**: Positive aspects (turnout, message not disruption)
- **Omissions**: Legitimate concerns about methods, impacts
- **Pattern**: Romanticizes protest

**Step 4 - Balanced Coverage Would Include**:

- Turnout numbers (both estimates, with attribution)
- Protest message and rationale (why people participated)
- Methods used (was it civil disobedience? What form?)
- Impact on businesses, traffic, residents (factually stated)
- Police response (appropriate? excessive? measured?)
- Multiple perspectives:
  - Organizers explaining goals
  - Participants sharing motivations
  - Affected businesses/residents
  - Officials responding
  - Policy experts on underlying issue
- Context on issue prompting protest
- Historical context (pattern of protests on this issue?)
- Outcomes (did it accomplish anything?)

**Step 5 - Evaluate Against Journalistic Standards**:

**Seek Truth and Report It**:

- Both outlets selective about facts
- Both need more diverse sourcing
- Both miss important context

**Minimize Harm**:

- Outlet A: Delegitimizing legitimate expression
- Outlet B: Ignoring real disruption to people's lives

**Act Independently**:

- Both appear aligned with ideological position
- Neither demonstrates independence

**Be Accountable**:

- Neither acknowledges their framing choices
- Neither transparent about limitations

**Step 6 - Synthesis**:
**Findings**:

- Both outlets covered same event with starkly different framing
- Both violated journalistic standards of balance and fairness
- Both served ideological perspectives over comprehensive truth
- Audiences consuming only one get distorted picture

**Implications**:

- Media bias is often about emphasis and omission, not fabrication
- Sourcing choices shape narrative profoundly
- Language matters enormously
- Citizens need media literacy to recognize bias
- Consuming diverse sources is essential

**Recommendations**:

- Read coverage from multiple outlets
- Note sourcing patterns
- Watch for loaded language
- Identify what's emphasized and omitted
- Seek primary sources when possible
- Recognize your own biases
