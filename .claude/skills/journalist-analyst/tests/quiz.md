## Scenario 1: Investigative Reporting on Government Corruption

**Event Description**:
A confidential source (mid-level bureaucrat in city government) contacts you with documents suggesting the mayor accepted bribes from a real estate developer in exchange for zoning variances worth millions. Evidence: Encrypted emails (source claims they're authentic), bank records showing unexplained $200,000 deposit in mayor's personal account, zoning decisions that contradict planning department recommendations, timeline correlation between payments and decisions. Source demands anonymity (fears retaliation, job loss). Challenges: Mayor denies wrongdoing ("routine fundraising, all legal"), developer refuses comment, encrypted emails cannot be independently verified, some evidence is circumstantial, source has potential bias (passed over for promotion by mayor's administration). Election is in 6 weeks. Your editor wants the story but legal counsel warns of defamation risk. Other news outlets are rumored to be pursuing similar tips.

**Analysis Task**:
Evaluate the evidence, assess reporting and ethical considerations, and recommend how to proceed.

### Expected Analysis Elements

- [ ] **Verification and Sourcing**:
  - Document authentication: Can encrypted emails be verified? (digital forensics, second sources)
  - Bank records: Legal obtain? Context needed (could $200k be legitimate?)
  - Multiple independent sources: Need corroboration beyond single source
  - On-the-record vs. anonymous: Can anyone speak on record?
  - Source motivation: Bias doesn't disqualify but requires transparency

- [ ] **Newsworthiness Assessment**:
  - Public interest: Government corruption affects all citizens (high newsworthiness)
  - Impact: Zoning decisions have financial and community consequences
  - Prominence: Mayor is elected official (public figure, lower defamation threshold)
  - Timeliness: Election context increases urgency but also risk of appearing political
  - Proximity: Local story with direct impact on readers

- [ ] **Journalistic Ethics**:
  - Accuracy imperative: Cannot publish unverified allegations (reputation destruction)
  - Harm minimization: If wrong, irreparable damage to mayor
  - Fairness: Mayor must have opportunity to respond before publication
  - Independence: Election timing raises questions about motive
  - Accountability: Can outlet defend story if sued?

- [ ] **Legal Considerations**:
  - Defamation risk: Public figure standard (actual malice: knowing falsity or reckless disregard)
  - Qualified privilege: Accurate reporting of official proceedings
  - Source protection: Shield laws vary by jurisdiction
  - Evidence strength: Circumstantial vs. direct evidence
  - Litigation preparedness: Can outlet afford legal defense?

- [ ] **Reporting Strategy**:
  - Additional sourcing: Seek planning department officials, other developers, city council members
  - Records requests: FOIA for mayor's schedule, campaign finance filings, zoning records
  - Expert consultation: Campaign finance lawyer, forensic accountant
  - Incremental publication: Report confirmed facts first (zoning decisions), then investigation findings
  - Right of reply: Give mayor detailed questions, sufficient response time

- [ ] **Precedents and Standards**:
  - Watergate: Anonymous sources (Deep Throat) but corroborated with documents
  - Pentagon Papers: Public interest outweighs government secrecy claims
  - Rolling Stone/UVA case: Failure to verify source claims led to defamation loss
  - Investigative best practices: IRE (Investigative Reporters and Editors) guidelines

### Evaluation Criteria

- **Domain Accuracy** (0-10): Correct application of verification standards, ethics frameworks
- **Analytical Depth** (0-10): Thoroughness of sourcing, legal, ethical analysis
- **Insight Specificity** (0-10): Clear reporting recommendations with risk assessment
- **Historical Grounding** (0-10): References to precedent cases, professional standards
- **Reasoning Clarity** (0-10): Logical balancing of public interest, accuracy, fairness

**Minimum Passing Score**: 35/50

## Scenario 2: Breaking News Crisis Coverage with Incomplete Information

**Event Description**:
Breaking: Reports of active shooter at a shopping mall (population: large suburban area). Initial information: 911 calls report gunshots and people running; police confirm "incident" but provide no details; social media shows panicked crowds evacuating; local TV has helicopter overhead showing police response; unconfirmed reports of casualties. Your outlet (digital news site) can publish immediately. Competitive pressure: Local TV is live-streaming, Twitter is full of rumors (some claiming terrorism, others domestic dispute), national outlets are picking up story. Information gaps: Number of shooters unknown, motive unknown, casualties unknown, suspect status unknown (captured? at large?). Sourcing challenges: Police won't confirm details (active situation), witnesses are traumatized and unreliable, social media is mix of fact and speculation. Ethical tensions: Speed vs. accuracy, public's right to know vs. avoiding panic, graphic content (if available) vs. dignity.

**Analysis Task**:
Design coverage strategy balancing speed, accuracy, and ethics in rapidly evolving crisis.

### Expected Analysis Elements

- [ ] **Breaking News Protocols**:
  - Verification threshold: Lower than investigative but still requires confirmation
  - Sourcing requirements: Official sources (police, hospital) prioritized; eyewitness accounts labeled as "witness reports"
  - Iterative updates: Publish confirmed facts, clearly label unconfirmed information
  - Corrections: Update story as new information emerges, note changes transparently
  - Restraint: Avoid speculation, don't amplify rumors

- [ ] **Information Hierarchy**:
  - **Confirmed facts**: Police confirm incident, evacuation underway (publish immediately)
  - **Unconfirmed but credible**: Witness reports of shots fired (publish with clear attribution)
  - **Unconfirmed and uncredible**: Social media rumors of terrorism (don't amplify, investigate separately)
  - **Unknown**: Casualties, motive, suspect (state explicitly what is not known)

- [ ] **Ethical Considerations**:
  - **Harm minimization**: Avoid graphic images (or warn), don't ID victims before family notification
  - **Dignity**: Avoid sensationalism, respect trauma
  - **Avoiding panic**: Don't overstate threat (but inform public if danger persists)
  - **Responsible use of social media**: Don't republish unverified videos/images without context
  - **Avoiding stereotyping**: Don't speculate about motive/identity based on bias

- [ ] **Competitive Pressure Management**:
  - Don't sacrifice accuracy for speed (being first but wrong is worse than being second and right)
  - Monitor competitors but don't match unverified claims
  - Add value beyond speed: Context, verification, analysis
  - Long-term reputation vs. short-term traffic

- [ ] **Audience Service**:
  - Safety information: Where is incident? Is threat ongoing? Shelter-in-place?
  - Reunification: Family assistance info, hotlines
  - Context: Past incidents, local history, national patterns (without inappropriate comparison)
  - Live updates: Timestamp all updates, most recent info at top
  - Transparency: Clearly label what is known/unknown/uncertain

- [ ] **Precedents and Failures**:
  - Sandy Hook: Media errors (wrong shooter ID, conflicting casualty counts)
  - Boston Marathon bombing: Reddit vigilante misidentification
  - Parkland shooting: Graphic social media circulation
  - Best practices: NPR's breaking news approach, Reuters verification guidelines

### Evaluation Criteria

- **Domain Accuracy** (0-10): Correct application of breaking news standards, verification protocols
- **Analytical Depth** (0-10): Thoroughness of speed-accuracy balance, ethical considerations
- **Insight Specificity** (0-10): Clear coverage strategy with decision criteria

## Scenario 3: Feature Story on Controversial Social Issue

**Event Description**:
Assignment: Write feature story on rising homelessness in your city (30% increase over 3 years). Approach options: (1) Policy focus (causes, government response, solutions debate), (2) Human interest (profile individuals experiencing homelessness), (3) Systemic analysis (housing market, mental health system, addiction services), (4) Community impact (business owners, residents, advocates). Sourcing challenges: Homeless individuals are vulnerable sources (trauma, mental health, exploitation risk); city officials blame state/federal policy; advocates blame city inaction; business owners want enforcement; housed residents have NIMBY concerns; issue is politically divisive (progressive vs. conservative framing). Ethical tensions: Avoiding exploitation while humanizing, balanced representation without false equivalence, accuracy without stereotyping, impact on vulnerable sources. Your editor wants "compelling narrative" but you're concerned about extractive journalism.

**Analysis Task**:
Design feature approach that is ethical, balanced, and impactful.

### Expected Analysis Elements

- [ ] **Story Framing**:
  - Avoid stereotypes: Homelessness is diverse (families, elderly, employed, veterans, not just "addict on street corner")
  - Structural vs. individual: Balance personal stories with systemic causes (housing costs, wages, safety net, mental health)
  - Complexity: Avoid simple heroes/villains (issue has multiple causes and stakeholders)
  - Solution-oriented: Not just problem description, explore approaches (Housing First, harm reduction, enforcement)

- [ ] **Source Diversity and Representation**:
  - Primary sources: People experiencing homelessness (critical, not tokenized)
  - Institutional: City officials, nonprofits, healthcare providers
  - Community: Business owners, residents, volunteers
  - Expert: Housing economists, public health researchers
  - Balance: Don't let one perspective dominate without justification

- [ ] **Ethical Engagement with Vulnerable Sources**:
  - Informed consent: Clear explanation of story purpose, how interview will be used
  - Autonomy: Source can review quotes, decline to answer, withdraw participation
  - Compensation: Consider paying sources for their time (addresses power imbalance)
  - Protection: Use pseudonyms if revealing identity creates risk
  - Dignity: Avoid voyeuristic details, respect humanity
  - Avoiding extraction: Story should serve source's interests, not just outlet's

- [ ] **Narrative Craft**:
  - Structure: Profile + policy analysis hybrid (personal story as entry, systemic context, solution exploration)
  - Scene-setting: Immersive detail without exploitation
  - Voice: Let sources speak in their own words (extensive quotes)
  - Context: Data, expert analysis to ground personal narratives
  - Arc: Not just "things are bad" but change over time, points of intervention

- [ ] **Balance and Fairness**:
  - Not false equivalence: If evidence supports one policy approach, say so (but acknowledge trade-offs)
  - Multiple perspectives: Homeless advocates AND business owners (even if disagreeing)
  - Accountability: Hold officials accountable for policy claims
  - Avoid both-sidesism: Homelessness is problem needing solution, not debate needing equal time

- [ ] **Precedents and Models**:
  - Solutions Journalism Network: Investigates responses to problems, not just problems
  - Katherine Boo (Behind the Beautiful Forevers): Immersive, respectful poverty reporting
  - Chris Hedges (Days of Destruction): Systemic focus with human stories
  - The Eviction Lab (Matthew Desmond): Data-driven homelessness/housing reporting
  - Seattle Times homelessness project: Multimedia, multi-perspective approach

### Evaluation Criteria

- **Domain Accuracy** (0-10): Correct application of feature journalism craft, ethical frameworks
- **Analytical Depth** (0-10): Thoroughness of framing, sourcing, ethical considerations
- **Insight Specificity** (0-10): Clear approach with narrative and ethical justification
- **Historical Grounding** (0-10): References to feature journalism models, best practices
- **Reasoning Clarity** (0-10): Logical balancing of narrative impact and ethical responsibility

**Minimum Passing Score**: 35/50

## Scenario 4: Fact-Checking and Misinformation Response

**Event Description**:
Context: Viral social media post claims a local factory is "poisoning the water supply" with "toxic chemicals" causing "cancer cluster" in nearby neighborhood. The post includes: Photo of discolored water (from factory discharge pipe), chart showing elevated cancer rates (source unclear), quotes from anonymous residents ("everyone here is sick"), link to petition demanding factory closure (10,000 signatures). The post is shared 50,000 times, local activists are organizing protest, factory (major employer, 500 jobs) denies wrongdoing. Your investigation finds: Factory has legal discharge permit (within EPA limits), discolored water is from iron oxide (not toxic), cancer rate data is cherry-picked (comparing 10-year average to single recent year; no statistical significance), broader county cancer rates are not elevated, state health department found no cluster in 5-year study. However: Some residents do report illness (anecdotal), factory has history of minor violations (corrected), environmental group says EPA limits are outdated and inadequate.

**Analysis Task**:
Design fact-check coverage that corrects misinformation while respecting community concerns.

### Expected Analysis Elements

- [ ] **Fact-Checking Framework**:
  - Claim identification: Break viral post into discrete factual claims
  - Verification: Check each claim against authoritative sources (EPA, health dept, scientific literature)
  - Rating system: True/False/Misleading/Unverifiable (with clear criteria)
  - Transparency: Show methodology, sources, limitations
  - Proportionality: Effort matches claim's spread and potential harm

- [ ] **Evidence Evaluation**:
  - **Photo**: Discolored water is real but misleading (iron oxide is not toxic)
  - **Cancer data**: Methodologically flawed (cherry-picked timeframe, no statistical test)
  - **Resident quotes**: Anecdotal, not verified medical diagnosis
  - **Factory permit**: Legal compliance is factual but "legal = safe" is value judgment
  - **Health study**: Most authoritative (state health dept, 5-year, comprehensive)

- [ ] **Communication Strategy**:
  - Lead with verdict: "Viral claim about factory poisoning is misleading" (clear, upfront)
  - Explain why: Break down each claim with evidence (transparent reasoning)
  - Acknowledge complexity: EPA limits are debatable, residents' concerns are real even if specific claims are wrong
  - Avoid condescension: Community fear is understandable, not stupid
  - Offer context: What are legitimate environmental concerns? How can residents engage productively?

- [ ] **Ethical Considerations**:
  - **Truth-telling**: Obligation to correct harmful misinformation
  - **Respect**: Community concerns may be misdirected but are genuine
  - **Avoiding false dichotomy**: "Viral post is wrong" ≠ "factory is perfect"
  - **Power dynamics**: Factory has resources to defend itself, residents don't
  - **Avoiding backfire effect**: Correction can reinforce false belief if done poorly (don't repeat misinformation excessively)

- [ ] **Solutions and Accountability**:
  - Offer actionable information: How can residents request independent testing? What are legitimate environmental monitoring processes?
  - Hold factory accountable: Even if viral claims are wrong, is factory transparent? Responsive to community?
  - Hold activists accountable: Misinformation undermines legitimate environmental advocacy
  - Systemic context: Are EPA limits adequate? What's the process for updating them?

- [ ] **Precedents and Research**:
  - Poynter/IFCN fact-checking standards
  - Backfire effect research (Nyhan & Reifler): Simply debunking can reinforce beliefs
  - Continued Influence Effect: Misinformation persists even after correction
  - Effective correction strategies: Affirmation, explanation, alternative narrative
  - Case studies: Flint water crisis (legitimate concern), Wind turbine health claims (debunked), Erin Brockovich case (real contamination)

### Evaluation Criteria

- **Domain Accuracy** (0-10): Correct application of fact-checking methods, misinformation research
- **Analytical Depth** (0-10): Thoroughness of evidence evaluation, communication strategy
- **Insight Specificity** (0-10): Clear approach to correction with community respect
- **Historical Grounding** (0-10): References to fact-checking standards, misinformation research
- **Reasoning Clarity** (0-10): Logical balancing of truth-telling and community engagement

**Minimum Passing Score**: 35/50

## Scenario 5: Editorial Independence vs. Business Pressure

**Event Description**:
Context: You are investigating labor practices at a major retailer (national chain, 10,000 employees, significant advertiser with your outlet - $500k annual revenue). Investigation findings: Systematic wage theft (off-the-clock work, timecard manipulation), unsafe working conditions (inadequate safety equipment, pressure to skip breaks), retaliation against workers who complain (demotions, scheduling cuts, termination). Evidence: 30 current/former employees interviewed (10 on record), internal documents (leaked by source), workers' compensation records, wage claim filings, OSHA reports. Retailer denies allegations, threatens to pull advertising if story publishes, demands review of story pre-publication (claims "inaccuracies" but won't specify). Your publisher (business side) is nervous about losing $500k; your editor (editorial side) supports publication; ownership is noncommittal. Legal counsel says story is defensible but lawsuit is possible. Alternative: You could soften the story (remove "systematic," focus on "some employees allege") or delay publication (seek more sources, give retailer more time).

**Analysis Task**:
Navigate editorial independence vs. business pressure and recommend course of action.

### Expected Analysis Elements

- [ ] **Journalistic Independence Principles**:
  - Separation of church and state: Editorial decisions must be independent of business interests
  - Public interest: Labor abuse investigation serves audience, not advertisers
  - Credibility: Caving to advertiser pressure destroys editorial trust
  - Precedent: Yielding once invites future pressure
  - Professional standards: SPJ Code of Ethics prioritizes public interest over commercial concerns

- [ ] **Evidence Strength Assessment**:
  - 30 sources with 10 on-record (strong)
  - Internal documents (corroboration)
  - Official records (OSHA, wage claims) (independent verification)
  - Pattern across sources (suggests systematic, not isolated)
  - Legal review: Defensible (reduces risk)
  - Conclusion: Evidence supports "systematic" characterization

- [ ] **Ethical Obligations**:
  - To sources: Promised to tell their story, backing down is betrayal
  - To audience: Public has right to know about labor abuse
  - To profession: Upholding journalism's watchdog role
  - To outlet: Long-term credibility vs. short-term revenue
  - To retailer: Fairness requires right of reply (already provided), not pre-publication approval

- [ ] **Business Realities and Alternatives**:
  - $500k loss: Significant but not existential for most outlets
  - Advertiser replacement: Can other advertisers fill gap?
  - Reader support: Investigation could drive subscriptions/donations (offset revenue loss)
  - Reputational value: Editorial integrity attracts quality audience
  - Advertiser bluff: May not actually pull ads (PR disaster for them too)

- [ ] **Strategic Response**:
  - **Non-negotiable**: No pre-publication review, no softening based on advertiser pressure
  - **Defensible**: Offer retailer specific response opportunity (detailed questions, reasonable deadline)
  - **Transparent**: If retailer pulls ads, consider disclosing (demonstrates independence)
  - **Internal**: Secure editorial leadership support before proceeding
  - **Contingency**: If publisher kills story, journalist can resign and take story elsewhere (last resort)

- [ ] **Precedents and Standards**:
  - LA Times/Staples Center scandal (1999): Editorial-business blurring destroyed credibility
  - Washington Post/Watergate: Held firm despite Nixon administration pressure
  - Tampa Bay Times/Scientology: Maintained coverage despite advertiser pressure
  - ProPublica model: Nonprofit removes advertiser pressure entirely
  - SPJ Code: "Deny favored treatment to advertisers, donors or any other special interests"

### Evaluation Criteria

- **Domain Accuracy** (0-10): Correct application of editorial independence principles, ethics
- **Analytical Depth** (0-10): Thoroughness of evidence assessment, strategic analysis
- **Insight Specificity** (0-10): Clear course of action with principled reasoning
- **Historical Grounding** (0-10): References to precedents, professional standards
- **Reasoning Clarity** (0-10): Logical prioritization of editorial integrity over business pressure

**Minimum Passing Score**: 35/50
