# Journalist Analyst - Quick Reference

## TL;DR

Analyzes events through journalistic lens using 5 Ws and H, source evaluation, fact-checking, and ethical principles to verify truth and serve public interest.

## When to Use

- Breaking news assessment and verification
- Fact-checking claims and statements
- Source credibility evaluation
- Media criticism and bias detection
- Information gap identification
- Story development and angles

## Core Frameworks

1. **5 Ws and H** - Who, What, When, Where, Why, How (complete story)
2. **Inverted Pyramid** - Most important information first, decreasing priority
3. **Newsworthiness** - Timeliness, proximity, impact, prominence, conflict, novelty
4. **Source Evaluation** - Authority, proximity, bias, corroboration, transparency

## SPJ Code of Ethics

1. **Seek Truth and Report It** - Verify, provide context, correct errors
2. **Minimize Harm** - Balance public need vs. harm, show compassion
3. **Act Independently** - Avoid conflicts, resist pressure
4. **Be Accountable** - Explain choices, respond to questions, correct promptly

## Quick Analysis Process

1. **Answer 5 Ws and H** - Establish factual foundation
2. **Evaluate Sources** - Credibility, bias, proximity, corroboration
3. **Assess Newsworthiness** - Why does this matter? Who's affected?
4. **Identify Gaps** - What's missing? What needs verification?
5. **Analyze Framing** - How is story told? What's emphasized/omitted?
6. **Verify Claims** - Check against original sources, seek corroboration
7. **Provide Context** - Background, precedents, perspective
8. **Check Ethics** - Balance, harm, fairness, transparency

## Key Questions

- Who, what, when, where, why, how?
- How do we know this is true?
- Who are the sources? How credible?
- What's missing from this story?
- Whose perspectives are absent?
- What needs verification?
- How is this framed? What's emphasized/omitted?
- What's the public interest?

## Common Pitfalls

- **Both-sidesism**: False balance (fact vs. falsehood)
- **Stenography**: Uncritically reporting statements
- **Burying the lede**: Missing the real story
- **Single-source stories**: Inadequate corroboration
- **Lack of context**: Facts without background mislead
- **Access journalism**: Compromising independence for access
