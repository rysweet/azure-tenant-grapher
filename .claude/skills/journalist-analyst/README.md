# Journalist Analyst Skill

> **Analyze events through the lens of journalism, applying the 5 Ws and H, investigative methods, and fact-checking to verify truth and serve public interest.**

## Overview

The Journalist Analyst skill enables Claude to perform rigorous journalistic analysis of events, applying established reporting frameworks, source evaluation techniques, and ethical journalism principles. Drawing on professional standards and investigative methods, this skill provides insights into:

- **Factual Foundation**: The 5 Ws and H (Who, What, When, Where, Why, How)
- **Source Credibility**: Evaluating reliability, bias, and proximity to events
- **Information Gaps**: What's missing, what needs verification
- **Newsworthiness**: Timeliness, impact, proximity, prominence, conflict
- **Framing and Bias**: How stories are told, what's emphasized or omitted
- **Ethical Dimensions**: Truth-seeking, minimizing harm, independence, accountability

## What Makes This Different

Unlike general analysis, journalist analysis:

1. **Focuses on Verification**: Always asks "How do we know this is true?"
2. **Applies Systematic Frameworks**: 5 Ws and H, inverted pyramid, sourcing standards
3. **Evaluates Sources Rigorously**: Credibility, proximity, bias, corroboration
4. **Identifies Information Gaps**: What's missing, what questions remain
5. **Serves Public Interest**: What citizens need to know, accountability
6. **Grounds in Facts**: Distinguishes fact, opinion, and analysis clearly

## Use Cases

### Breaking News Analysis

- Rapidly assessing developing events
- Verifying emerging claims
- Identifying what's known vs. unknown
- Evaluating initial reporting quality

### Fact-Checking

- Verifying specific claims
- Identifying misinformation
- Assessing evidence quality
- Tracking claims to original sources

### Source Evaluation

- Assessing credibility and reliability
- Identifying bias and conflicts of interest
- Evaluating expert qualifications
- Determining source proximity to events

### Media Criticism

- Identifying what's emphasized or omitted
- Comparing coverage across outlets
- Recognizing bias patterns

## Journalistic Frameworks Available

### Core Frameworks

- **5 Ws and H**: Who, What, When, Where, Why, How - complete story elements
- **Inverted Pyramid**: Most important information first, decreasing priority
- **Newsworthiness Criteria**: Timeliness, proximity, impact, prominence, conflict, human interest, novelty
- **Source Evaluation**: Authority, proximity, bias, corroboration, transparency

### Ethical Principles (SPJ Code)

- **Seek Truth and Report It**: Verify, provide context, acknowledge mistakes
- **Minimize Harm**: Balance public need vs. potential harm, show compassion
- **Act Independently**: Avoid conflicts, resist pressure, distinguish news from opinion
- **Be Accountable**: Explain choices, respond to questions, correct errors promptly

### Investigative Methods

- **Document Analysis**: Public records, financial disclosures, FOIA requests
- **Following the Money**: Financial relationships, conflicts of interest
- **Data Journalism**: Statistical analysis, pattern recognition, visualization
- **Human Sources**: Whistleblowers, insiders, experts, affected parties

### Verification Techniques

- **Identify Claims**: What needs checking
- **Find Original Source**: Trace to primary sources
- **Seek Corroboration**: Multiple independent sources
- **Check Context**: Are statistics used appropriately?
- **Assess Confidence**: Verified, likely, uncertain, false

## Quick Start

### Basic Usage

```
Claude, use the journalist-analyst skill to analyze [EVENT/CLAIM/STORY].

Examples:
- "Use journalist-analyst to fact-check this policy announcement."
- "Analyze the breaking news story using journalist-analyst skill."
- "Use the journalist skill to evaluate the credibility of these sources."
```

### Advanced Usage

Specify particular frameworks or focus areas:

```
"Use journalist-analyst to answer the 5 Ws and H for this event."

"Apply journalist-analyst to compare how different outlets are framing this story."

"Use journalist-analyst to identify information gaps and follow-up questions."
```

## Analysis Process

The journalist analyst follows a systematic 10-step process:

1. **Establish Basic Facts (5 Ws and H)** - Systematically answer foundational questions
2. **Evaluate Sources** - Assess credibility, proximity, bias, adequacy
3. **Assess Newsworthiness** - Apply criteria, determine significance
4. **Identify Information Gaps** - Note missing Ws, unchallenged claims, absent perspectives
5. **Analyze Framing** - Examine how story is presented, what's emphasized
6. **Verify Key Claims** - Seek independent verification, check against original sources
7. **Provide Context** - Historical background, comparative analysis, perspective
8. **Assess Ethical Dimensions** - Consider harm vs. public interest, fairness, transparency
9. **Construct Timeline** - Build chronology, identify cause-effect relationships
10. **Synthesize Findings** - Integrate analysis, acknowledge uncertainty, recommend follow-up

## Example Analyses

### Example 1: Policy Announcement

**Event**: Government announces $500B stimulus package

**Journalistic Analysis**:

- **Who**: Government officials, affected industries, taxpayers
- **What**: $500B stimulus (breakdown needed)
- **When**: Announced today (implementation timeline?)
- **Where**: National (distribution?)
- **Why**: Combat recession (economic indicators?)
- **How**: Tax cuts, direct payments, infrastructure (details?)

**Source Evaluation**: Official government source (authoritative but interested party), need independent expert verification

**Information Gaps**: Exact allocation, funding mechanism, economic impact projections, political feasibility

**Newsworthiness**: High - timely, significant impact, major policy

**Follow-Up**: Verify figures, consult independent economists, interview affected groups, check legislative process

### Example 2: Corporate Scandal

**Event**: Tech company accused of deceptive data collection

**Journalistic Analysis**:

- **Verification Strategy**: Obtain internal documents, analyze code, consult independent experts, interview employees
- **Source Assessment**: Whistleblower + documentary evidence + independent verification = strong
- **Information Gaps**: Exact users affected, company response, regulatory action, user protection steps
- **Ethical Dimensions**: Clear public interest, protect whistleblower, don't expose individual user data, give company fair chance to respond

**Investigation Path**: Documentary evidence → expert verification → company response → comprehensive report → ongoing coverage

### Example 3: Comparing Coverage

**Event**: Protest covered differently by two outlets

**Analysis**:

- **Outlet A**: Headline emphasizes disruption, sources business owners/police, language "mob/chaos," omits protest rationale
- **Outlet B**: Headline emphasizes turnout/message, sources organizers/participants, language "activists/demonstrators," omits disruption impacts
- **Both**: Selective sourcing, biased framing, violations of balance standards
- **Implication**: Audiences consuming only one outlet get distorted picture, media literacy essential
