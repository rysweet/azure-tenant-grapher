## Scenario 1: Corporate Culture Clash in Multinational Merger

**Event Description**:
US tech company acquires Japanese manufacturing firm. Integration struggles emerge immediately: American executives push "flat hierarchy" and "speak up culture," but Japanese employees remain silent in meetings. Americans email directly to any level; Japanese insist on going through proper channels. Deadlines constantly missed - Americans interpret as incompetence, Japanese see American timelines as unrealistic. Gift-giving by Japanese team seen as bribery concern by US compliance. Japanese expect after-work socialization for team building; Americans leave at 5pm. Turnover in Japanese subsidiary reaches 30% in first year. Both sides frustrated, seeing the other as difficult and unprofessional.

**Analysis Task**:
Provide anthropological analysis of the cultural clash and recommendations.

### Expected Analysis Elements

- [ ] **Cultural Dimensions Theory (Hofstede)**:
  - **Power Distance**: US low (flat hierarchy), Japan high (respect for hierarchy)
  - **Individualism vs. Collectivism**: US individualist (speak up), Japan collectivist (group harmony)
  - **Uncertainty Avoidance**: Japan high (process, planning), US lower (flexibility)
  - **Long-term vs. Short-term Orientation**: Japan long-term, US quarterly focus
  - **Masculinity/Femininity**: Different approaches to work-life balance

- [ ] **High-Context vs. Low-Context Communication (Hall)**:
  - US: Low-context - direct, explicit, verbal communication
  - Japan: High-context - indirect, implicit, contextual cues
  - Silence as communication in Japanese culture (vs. discomfort in US)
  - Email directness vs. face-saving through intermediaries
  - Misinterpretation as incompetence rather than cultural difference

- [ ] **Face and Social Harmony (Goffman, East Asian concepts)**:
  - Face-work: Preserving dignity and reputation
  - Honne vs. Tatemae: Private feelings vs. public facade
  - Nemawashi: Pre-meeting consensus building (invisible to Americans)
  - Speaking up in meetings = potential face loss for Japanese
  - Direct criticism violates Japanese norms of indirection

- [ ] **Gift Exchange and Reciprocity (Mauss, Malinowski)**:
  - Gift-giving as relationship building (Japanese cultural practice)
  - Reciprocity obligations create social bonds
  - Kula ring analog: Gifts circulate, create networks
  - American interpretation through compliance/corruption lens
  - Cultural relativism: Gift vs. bribe depends on cultural framework

- [ ] **Time Orientation and Polychronic vs. Monochronic (Hall)**:
  - Monochronic (US): Linear time, one thing at a time, deadlines sacred
  - Polychronic (Japan in relationships): Flexible time for relationship maintenance
  - But: Japanese precision in manufacturing context
  - Missed deadlines = different time philosophies + process differences
  - After-work socializing = relationship building (not optional in Japanese frame)

- [ ] **Organizational Culture as Symbolic System (Geertz, Schein)**:
  - Thick description: Multiple layers of meaning in behaviors
  - Artifacts: Office layout, dress codes, meeting rituals
  - Espoused values vs. basic assumptions divergence
  - Integration challenge: Not just process, but worldviews
  - Sensemaking: Each culture interprets other through own framework

- [ ] **Emic vs. Etic Perspectives**:
  - Emic (insider): How Japanese employees experience "silence," "hierarchy," "gifts"
  - Etic (outsider): American interpretation of same behaviors
  - Misattribution: Both sides assume bad intent rather than cultural logic
  - Anthropological relativism: Understand behavior in cultural context
  - Neither culture "right" - different adaptive strategies

- [ ] **Ethnographic Recommendations**:
  - Cultural liaison roles: Bicultural brokers
  - Cross-cultural training: Both directions, not just Japanese adapting
  - Hybrid practices: Negotiated third culture
  - Participant observation: Leaders experience both contexts
  - Explicit negotiation of norms rather than assumption of universality

### Evaluation Criteria

- **Domain Accuracy** (0-10): Correct application of cultural dimensions, context theory, gift exchange
- **Analytical Depth** (0-10): Thoroughness of symbolic analysis, multiple frameworks
- **Insight Specificity** (0-10): Clear cultural mechanisms, specific recommendations

## Scenario 2: Traditional Healing vs. Biomedicine in Indigenous Community

**Event Description**:
Public health initiative introduces Western medical clinic in indigenous community in Amazon. After 2 years, utilization remains low (20% of population). Community continues visiting traditional healers for most ailments. Health workers frustrated, citing "ignorance" and "superstition." Ethnographic observation reveals: Illness attributed to spiritual causes (soul loss, spirit intrusion, sorcery), not just biological. Traditional healers provide explanatory frameworks connecting illness to social disruptions, dreams, and moral transgressions. Biomedicine seen as effective for "white people's diseases" but inadequate for "our diseases." Some community members use both systems, but hide traditional healing from clinic staff. Healers hold social prestige; doctors seen as outsiders.

## Scenario 3: Digital Ethnography of Online Gaming Community

**Event Description**:
Massively multiplayer online game (MMO) develops complex in-game society over 5 years. Player ethnography reveals: elaborate economy with virtual currency tradeable for real money, guilds with formal hierarchies and constitutions, dispute resolution mechanisms, initiation rituals for new members, shared mythology and origin stories, distinct linguistic register and slang, gift economies alongside market transactions, strong in-group identity ("gamers" vs. "normies"), moral codes around fair play and cheating. Guild leaders command respect comparable to offline authority figures. Players spend 20-40 hours weekly in-game, forming meaningful relationships and deriving identity from virtual accomplishments.

## Scenario 4: Food Taboos and Cultural Meaning Systems

**Event Description**:
Comparative analysis of food taboos across cultures: Hindu beef avoidance (cow as sacred), Jewish and Muslim pork prohibition, Jain extreme vegetarianism (ahimsa), European horse meat taboo, East Asian dog meat controversies, American disgust at insects despite nutritional value. Material explanations (ecological, health) fail to fully explain patterns: Pigs would be efficient protein in Middle East, cows expensive to maintain in India with limited grazing. Taboos persist despite nutritional costs. Violation provokes moral outrage, not just preference. Food taboos mark group boundaries, and immigrants pressured to maintain practices.

**Analysis Task**:
Analyze food taboos through anthropological theories of culture and meaning.

### Expected Analysis Elements

- [ ] **Symbolic and Structuralist Approaches (Douglas, Levi-Strauss)**:
  - Food as symbol system, not just nutrition
  - Purity and Danger (Douglas): Taboos police symbolic boundaries
  - Anomalous animals: Pigs (neither fully land nor fully hoof-split), violate categories
  - Structural oppositions: Sacred/profane, clean/unclean, edible/inedible
  - Totem and taboo: Animals as good to think with (Levi-Strauss)

- [ ] **Cultural Materialism Critique (Harris)**:
  - Materialist explanation: Pork prohibition in hot climates (trichinosis, resource inefficiency)
  - Cow protection in India: More valuable alive (traction, dung fuel, milk) than dead
  - Ecological adaptation: Taboos as resource management
  - BUT: Symbolic dimension not reducible to material base
  - Overdetermination: Material and symbolic factors both operative

- [ ] **Durkheim: Sacred and Profane**:
  - Sacred cows: Totem representing collective values
  - Totemism: Animal identifies group, forbidden to kill/eat
  - Collective representation: Cow = Hindu identity
  - Ritual regulation: Taboo maintains boundary between sacred and profane
  - Social function: Strengthens group solidarity through shared restrictions

- [ ] **Group Identity and Boundary Maintenance (Barth)**:
  - Food taboos as ethnic markers: "We don't eat X"
  - Boundary work: Distinguish in-group from out-group
  - Commensality: Eating together creates community, taboos restrict who you eat with
  - Dietary laws maintain diaspora identity (Jewish kashrut)
  - Immigrants resist host food culture to preserve identity

- [ ] **Moral Disgust and Ethical Systems**:
  - Disgust as moral emotion (not just visceral)
  - Animals as quasi-persons: Dogs as companions, not food (in West)
  - Jain ahimsa: Non-violence extended to all life
  - Western vegetarianism: Animal rights, environmental ethics
  - Cultural relativism: No universal standard of edible/inedible

- [ ] **Power, Hegemony, and Resistance**:
  - Dominant groups impose food standards: Colonizers stigmatize indigenous diets
  - Dog meat controversy: Western cultural imperialism vs. cultural relativism
  - Insect consumption potential: Overcoming Western bias
  - Globalization: McDonald's vs. local food practices
  - Food as resistance: Maintaining traditional diet asserts autonomy

- [ ] **Anthropology of Taste (Bourdieu, Mintz)**:
  - Taste is cultural, not natural: Acquired through socialization
  - Habitus: Embodied dispositions (disgust is learned)
  - Distinction: Food choices signal class, education, identity
  - Historical construction: Horse meat taboo post-19th century in US
  - Sweetness and Power (Mintz): Food meanings tied to political economy

- [ ] **Applied Implications**:
  - Nutrition interventions must respect cultural meaning
  - Insect protein adoption requires cultural reframing
  - Food security: Some solutions culturally unacceptable
  - Multicultural contexts: Accommodate diverse dietary practices
  - No universal food rationality

### Evaluation Criteria

- **Domain Accuracy** (0-10): Correct application of Douglas, Durkheim, structuralism, materialism
- **Analytical Depth** (0-10): Thoroughness of symbolic analysis, boundary work, power dynamics
- **Insight Specificity** (0-10): Clear explanation of specific taboos through cultural logic
- **Historical Grounding** (0-10): References to anthropological theory, comparative cases
- **Reasoning Clarity** (0-10): Logical flow from observation to symbolic interpretation

**Minimum Passing Score**: 35/50

## Scenario 5: Revitalization Movement and Cultural Change

**Event Description**:
Indigenous community experiences rapid cultural change due to resource extraction on traditional lands: young people migrate to cities for work, traditional language declining (only elders fluent), ceremonial practices eroding, social problems increase (substance abuse, suicide). Charismatic leader emerges proposing cultural revitalization: language immersion schools, revival of banned ceremonies, land reclamation activism, rejection of Western influences (alcohol, Christianity), return to "traditional ways." Movement attracts youth, creates tension between revivalists and assimilationists. Government sees movement as threat; some anthropologists critique as "invented tradition." Movement provides purpose and identity for demoralized community.

**Analysis Task**:
