## Scenario 1: Coral Reef Collapse and Marine Ecosystem Cascade

**Event Description**:
A major coral reef system spanning 500 square kilometers experiences severe bleaching, with 70% of corals showing stress and 40% already dead. Water temperatures exceeded thermal tolerance thresholds for six consecutive weeks during an unusually severe marine heatwave. The reef supports over 1,500 fish species, provides nursery habitat for commercial fisheries, protects coastlines from storm surge, and generates $200 million annually in tourism. Scientists observe cascading effects: Herbivorous fish populations declining (triggering algae overgrowth on dead coral), parrotfish stress (reducing coral sand production for beaches), loss of structural complexity (reducing habitat niches), and crown-of-thorns starfish outbreak (opportunistic predation on weakened corals). Nearby communities dependent on fishing report 50% catch declines. Climate models project continued ocean warming and increased bleaching frequency. Proposed responses range from local interventions (coral nurseries, algae removal) to systemic approaches (rapid decarbonization, marine protected areas).

**Analysis Task**:
Provide comprehensive ecological analysis of this reef collapse and evaluate response strategies.

### Expected Analysis Elements

- [ ] **Ecosystem Functions & Services Analysis**:
  - **Biodiversity**: Reef as hotspot (1,500+ species, likely understated), genetic diversity
  - **Nursery habitat**: Juvenile fish recruitment for commercial/subsistence fisheries
  - **Structural services**: Wave attenuation, coastal protection, beach sand generation
  - **Biogeochemical**: Calcium carbonate deposition, carbon cycling, nutrient processing
  - **Cultural/economic**: Tourism, subsistence, indigenous cultural values
  - **Interconnectedness**: Reef health affects entire coastal-marine system

- [ ] **Cascade Dynamics - Trophic & Structural**:
  - Coral death → algae proliferation (loss of coral-algae competition)
  - Herbivore decline → algae dominance reinforced (positive feedback loop)
  - Structural collapse → habitat loss → species decline (spatial niche loss)
  - Parrotfish stress → reduced bioerosion → less sand → beach erosion
  - Predator-prey imbalance → crown-of-thorns outbreak (opportunistic)
  - Fishery collapse → human food security → increased pressure on remaining stocks
  - Regime shift risk: Coral-dominated → algae-dominated state (alternative stable state)

- [ ] **Climate Change - Root Cause Analysis**:
  - Marine heatwaves: Frequency and intensity increasing with climate change
  - Thermal stress: Corals near upper tolerance limits globally
  - Ocean acidification: Synergistic stressor (weakens coral skeletons, reduces calcification)
  - Sea level rise: Changes light availability, sediment dynamics
  - Extreme weather: Hurricanes, storms cause physical damage
  - Interconnected: Local interventions insufficient without addressing climate root cause

- [ ] **Local vs. Systemic Stressors**:
  - **Local**: Overfishing (removes herbivores), pollution (nutrients fuel algae), coastal development (sedimentation), tourism damage (physical stress)
  - **Systemic**: Climate change (temperature, acidification), global carbon emissions
  - Interaction: Local stressors reduce resilience to climate impacts
  - Management: Local interventions buy time but systemic solutions essential

- [ ] **Response Strategy Evaluation**:
  - **Coral Nurseries**: Limited scale, expensive, doesn't address causes (band-aid)
  - **Algae Removal**: Treats symptom, not cause; labor-intensive, temporary
  - **Marine Protected Areas (MPAs)**: Reduce local stressors, increase resilience, critical but insufficient alone
  - **Herbivore Recovery**: Fishing restrictions allow herbivore rebound, control algae (high leverage)
  - **Assisted Evolution**: Breed heat-tolerant corals (promising but experimental, ethical questions)
  - **Rapid Decarbonization**: Only solution addressing root cause (essential but slow effect)
  - **Integrated Approach**: Combine local resilience-building + systemic climate action

- [ ] **Social-Ecological Systems**:
  - Human communities dependent on reef health
  - Feedback loops: Fishery decline → increased pressure → further decline
  - Environmental justice: Coastal communities (often marginalized) bear loss
  - Traditional ecological knowledge: Indigenous reef management practices
  - Livelihoods transition: Need alternative income as reef services decline

- [ ] **Temporal Dynamics & Tipping Points**:
  - Recovery time: Decades for coral regrowth (if conditions stabilize)
  - Tipping point: Threshold beyond which reef cannot recover (regime shift)
  - Window closing: Urgent action needed before irreversible shift
  - Intergenerational: Decisions now affect ecosystems for centuries

### Evaluation Criteria

- **Domain Accuracy** (0-10): Correct application of ecosystem ecology, trophic dynamics, climate science
- **Analytical Depth** (0-10): Thoroughness of cascade analysis, stressor interaction, response evaluation
- **Insight Specificity** (0-10): Clear identification of leverage points, feedback loops, systemic solutions
- **Historical/Contextual Grounding** (0-10): References to coral bleaching events, regime shifts, restoration efforts
- **Reasoning Clarity** (0-10): Logical flow from ecological processes to systemic analysis to solutions

**Minimum Passing Score**: 35/50

## Scenario 2: Industrial Agriculture, Biodiversity Loss, and Pollinator Collapse

**Event Description**:
A major agricultural region experiences 60% decline in wild pollinator populations (bees, butterflies, moths, beetles) over 15 years. Simultaneously, crop yields for pollinator-dependent crops (almonds, apples, blueberries, squash) decline 25-40%, threatening food security and farm economics. The agricultural landscape is characterized by large monoculture fields, intensive pesticide use (neonicotinoids, herbicides), elimination of hedgerows and wildflower margins, and tile drainage removing wetlands. Surrounding ecosystems show biodiversity collapse: 75% decline in insect biomass, 50% decline in insectivorous birds, and loss of native plant diversity. Farmers face economic crisis as pollination services valued at $300 million are lost. Some farmers rent commercial honeybee hives, but honeybees also show high mortality from pesticide exposure and disease. Scientists identify synergistic stressors: Pesticide toxicity, habitat loss, disease, climate stress, and nutritional deficiency from floral resource scarcity.

**Analysis Task**:
Analyze the ecological crisis and evaluate agricultural system transformation pathways.

### Expected Analysis Elements

- [ ] **Pollination Ecology - Critical Service**:
  - 75% of crop species benefit from animal pollination
  - Wild pollinators: More efficient than honeybees for many crops, diverse functional groups
  - Ecosystem service value: Hundreds of billions globally, often invisible/unpriced
  - Biodiversity-stability relationship: Diverse pollinator communities provide resilience
  - Native plant reproduction: Wild plants also depend on pollinators (cascading biodiversity loss)

- [ ] **Synergistic Stressor Analysis**:
  - **Pesticides**: Neonicotinoids (neurotoxic to bees), herbicides (eliminate floral resources)
  - **Habitat loss**: Monocultures eliminate nesting sites, floral diversity, overwintering habitat
  - **Nutritional stress**: Single-crop landscapes provide poor diet (temporal/spatial resource scarcity)
  - **Disease**: Spillover from commercial bees, weakened immunity from stressors
  - **Climate change**: Phenological mismatch (flowers/pollinators out of sync), heat stress
  - Synergies: Stressors interact, cumulative impact exceeds sum of parts

- [ ] **Industrial Agriculture Critique - Structural**:
  - Monocultures: Eliminate biodiversity, simplify ecosystems, increase vulnerability
  - Chemical dependence: Pesticides, fertilizers, herbicides (ecological harm, cost treadmill)
  - Consolidation: Large farms, economies of scale prioritize efficiency over ecology
  - Short-term thinking: Maximize annual yield, ignore long-term ecosystem degradation
  - Externalized costs: Pollution, biodiversity loss, health impacts not borne by producers
  - Subsidy structures: Government policies incentivize intensive, high-input agriculture

- [ ] **Ecosystem Service Loss - Cascading Effects**:
  - Pollination decline → crop yield loss → food security, economic impacts
  - Insect decline → bird decline (food web collapse)
  - Native plant loss → further pollinator decline (positive feedback loop)
  - Soil health: Loss of insect-mediated nutrient cycling, reduced organic matter
  - Pest control: Loss of natural enemies (predatory insects, birds)
  - Water quality: Pesticides contaminate waterways, harm aquatic ecosystems

- [ ] **Agroecology - Alternative Paradigm**:
  - Diversified farming: Polycultures, crop rotation, integrated livestock
  - Habitat integration: Hedgerows, flower strips, beetle banks, buffer zones
  - Reduced chemical inputs: Integrated pest management, organic methods
  - Ecological intensification: Harness ecosystem services, not just chemical inputs
  - Small-scale, knowledge-intensive: Farmer expertise, adaptive management
  - Resilience focus: Diversity provides insurance against shocks

- [ ] **Policy & Systemic Change Levers**:
  - Pesticide regulation: Ban or restrict neonicotinoids, systemic insecticides
  - Subsidy reform: Reward ecological practices, not just yield maximization
  - Landscape planning: Mandate habitat corridors, set-aside areas, buffer zones
  - Pollinator habitat incentives: Payment for ecosystem services (PES) schemes
  - Research investment: Agroecological methods, not just chemical solutions
  - Market transformation: Organic certification, pollinator-friendly labels, consumer demand

- [ ] **Just Transition for Farmers**:
  - Economic risk: Transition period before agroecology fully productive
  - Knowledge gap: Training needed for ecological farming methods
  - Market access: Infrastructure for diversified products, local markets
  - Financial support: Grants, loans, insurance during transition
  - Cooperative models: Farmer networks for knowledge sharing, market power
  - Fair pricing: Consumers/policy must value ecological farming

### Evaluation Criteria

- **Domain Accuracy** (0-10): Correct application of pollination ecology, agroecology, ecosystem service science
- **Analytical Depth** (0-10): Thoroughness of synergistic stressor analysis, systemic critique, alternatives
- **Insight Specificity** (0-10): Clear identification of leverage points, transition pathways, policy solutions
- **Historical/Contextual Grounding** (0-10): References to pollinator decline research, agroecology movements
- **Reasoning Clarity** (0-10): Logical flow from ecological processes to systemic problems to transformative solutions

**Minimum Passing Score**: 35/50

## Scenario 3: Urban Environmental Justice - Toxic Sites and Green Gentrification

**Event Description**:
A low-income, predominantly minority urban neighborhood has endured decades of environmental injustice: A decommissioned chemical plant left soil contaminated with heavy metals and carcinogens, a highway bisects the community (air pollution, noise), industrial zoning permits polluting facilities nearby, and there are no parks or green spaces within walking distance. Residents face elevated rates of asthma, cancer, and lead poisoning. A city initiative proposes brownfield remediation and creation of a large "green infrastructure" park with bike paths, community gardens, and stormwater management. Environmental groups celebrate. However, community organizers raise concerns: No residents were involved in planning, remediation plans don't fully address contamination (capping, not removal), the park will increase property values and accelerate gentrification (displacing current residents), and resources go to park aesthetics rather than health services or economic development. This scenario illustrates tension between ecological restoration and environmental justice, and the risk of "green gentrification."

**Analysis Task**:
Analyze through environmental justice framework and propose equitable urban ecology solutions.

### Expected Analysis Elements

- [ ] **Environmental Justice - Core Principles**:
  - Distributive justice: Fair distribution of environmental benefits and burdens
  - Procedural justice: Meaningful participation in decision-making
  - Recognition justice: Respect for diverse knowledge, cultures, and rights
  - Restorative justice: Remedy for historical harms and ongoing inequities
  - Historical pattern: Toxic sites, pollution disproportionately in marginalized communities
  - Structural racism: Redlining, zoning, land use as environmental racism mechanisms

- [ ] **Historical Context - Structural Injustice**:
  - Industrial zoning: Polluting facilities sited in politically powerless communities
  - Redlining: Disinvestment in minority neighborhoods, declining property values attract polluters
  - Highway construction: Urban renewal destroyed neighborhoods, created pollution corridors
  - Cumulative exposure: Multiple environmental burdens (chemical plant + highway + industrial)
  - Health disparities: Environmental racism causes disease burden
  - Wealth extraction: Property devaluation, health costs borne by residents

- [ ] **Green Gentrification - Paradox**:
  - Definition: Ecological improvement triggers displacement of vulnerable residents
  - Mechanism: Green amenities increase property values → rents rise → displacement
  - Irony: Environmental justice achieved through greening, then original community can't benefit
  - Who benefits?: New, wealthier residents; original community displaced
  - "Eco-gentrification": Environmental improvements as tool of inequality
  - Not inevitable: Design choices and policies can prevent this outcome

- [ ] **Remediation Critique - Inadequate**:
  - Capping vs. removal: Capping is cheaper but leaves contamination in place (risk remains)
  - Long-term liability: Caps fail, exposing future residents
  - Participatory standard: Residents should decide acceptable risk level, not experts alone
  - Health prioritization: Medical services, blood lead testing, health monitoring essential
  - Right to return: If area becomes habitable, original residents should have priority
  - Corporate accountability: Polluters should pay for full remediation, not taxpayers

- [ ] **Procedural Injustice - Planning Process**:
  - Top-down: City/NGOs designed park without community input
  - Expertise hierarchy: Professional planners valued over lived experience
  - Tokenism risk: Post-hoc "community engagement" after decisions made
  - Power dynamics: Who has resources to participate? (Meetings during work hours, language access)
  - Authentic participation: Community-led planning, co-design, decision-making authority
  - Indigenous to area: Long-term residents as experts on neighborhood needs

- [ ] **Equitable Urban Ecology - Alternative Approach**:
  - Community-led: Residents define priorities (health, housing, jobs, then green space)
  - Anti-displacement measures: Community land trusts, affordable housing mandates, rent control
  - Full remediation: Remove contamination, not just cap (polluter pays principle)
  - Meaningful participation: Co-governance from outset, resources for community organizing
  - Holistic investment: Green space + health services + economic development + education
  - Right to stay: Legal protections ensuring current residents benefit from improvements
  - Local hiring: Job training, employment for residents in remediation and park jobs

- [ ] **Policy Mechanisms - Just Greening**:
  - Community land trusts: Remove land from speculative market
  - Inclusionary zoning: Mandate affordable housing in new development
  - Anti-displacement funds: Rental assistance, property tax freezes
  - Community benefits agreements: Binding commitments from developers
  - Participatory budgeting: Residents decide spending priorities
  - Environmental bond: Polluters fund health monitoring, services for affected residents
  - Restorative justice: Reparations for historical environmental racism

### Evaluation Criteria

- **Domain Accuracy** (0-10): Correct understanding of environmental justice, green gentrification, urban ecology
- **Analytical Depth** (0-10): Thoroughness of historical analysis, power dynamics, equitable alternatives
- **Insight Specificity** (0-10): Clear identification of procedural injustice, anti-displacement mechanisms
- **Historical/Contextual Grounding** (0-10): References to environmental racism, urban ecology, gentrification research
- **Reasoning Clarity** (0-10): Logical flow from structural analysis to equitable solutions

**Minimum Passing Score**: 35/50

## Scenario 4: Old-Growth Forest Protection vs. Timber Economy

**Event Description**:
The last 30,000 acres of intact old-growth temperate rainforest in a region face logging under government-approved timber harvest plans. The forest is 300-800 years old, contains giant trees, hosts endangered species (spotted owl, marbled murrelet, Pacific fisher), stores massive carbon (both trees and soil), regulates watershed for salmon streams, and holds cultural significance for indigenous nations whose ancestral territories include this forest. The timber company argues logging provides 400 jobs in economically depressed rural communities, generates tax revenue, and uses "sustainable forestry" practices (replanting after harvest). Environmentalists seek permanent protection, citing irreplaceable biodiversity, carbon storage, and ecosystem services. A lawsuit challenges logging based on Endangered Species Act violations. Meanwhile, timber workers rally, fearing job loss. Indigenous nations assert sovereignty and demand co-management. The scenario pits short-term economic needs against long-term ecological integrity, while raising questions about just transition and whose voices matter.

**Analysis Task**:
Analyze the ecological, economic, and justice dimensions and propose integrated solutions.

### Expected Analysis Elements

- [ ] **Old-Growth Ecology - Irreplaceable Values**:
  - Structural complexity: Multi-layered canopy, large woody debris, standing snags
  - Biodiversity: Old-growth specialist species (spotted owl, murrelets, fungi, lichens)
  - Carbon storage: 2-3x more carbon than young forests (trees + soil organic matter)
  - Resilience: More resistant to fire, drought, pests than plantations
  - Watershed function: Regulate water flow, reduce erosion, maintain stream temperature
  - Regeneration time: 300-800 years (effectively irreplaceable on human timescales)
  - Mycorrhizal networks: Complex underground fungal-root systems (decades to establish)

- [ ] **Plantation Forestry Critique - Not Equivalent**:
  - "Sustainable forestry": Replanting ≠ ecological restoration
  - Tree farms vs. forests: Monocultures lack biodiversity, structural complexity
  - Short rotations: Harvest every 40-80 years prevents old-growth development
  - Ecological impoverishment: Loss of specialist species, ecosystem services
  - Carbon accounting: Plantations store less carbon, accounting ignores soil carbon loss
  - Watershed degradation: Erosion, stream sedimentation, temperature impacts

- [ ] **False Dilemma - Jobs vs. Environment**:
  - Framing: Assumes only choice is log old-growth or lose jobs
  - Ignored options: Restoration jobs, sustainable harvest of already-logged areas, economic diversification
  - Historical context: Timber industry mechanization reduced jobs long before protection
  - Boom-bust cycle: Logging exhausts resource, then jobs disappear anyway
  - Just transition: Support workers without sacrificing irreplaceable ecosystems

- [ ] **Economic Analysis - Short-term vs. Long-term**:
  - Timber jobs: 400 jobs for 10-20 years (until forest logged out)
  - Ecosystem services: Watershed protection, carbon storage, biodiversity (indefinite)
  - Tourism/recreation: Old-growth tourism potential (sustainable revenue)
  - Non-market values: Existence value, cultural value, option value (future uses)
  - Discounting problem: Future benefits undervalued in conventional economic analysis
  - Intergenerational equity: Logging benefits current generation, costs future generations

- [ ] **Indigenous Sovereignty & Knowledge**:
  - Ancestral territory: Forest as relative, sacred, integral to cultural identity
  - Traditional Ecological Knowledge: Millennia of relationship, management
  - Sovereignty claims: Legal and moral rights to co-manage or control decisions
  - Colonial pattern: Resource extraction on indigenous lands without consent
  - Free, Prior, Informed Consent (FPIC): Should apply to forest management decisions
  - Indigenous conservation: Most effective protection involves indigenous stewardship

- [ ] **Ecological vs. Social Justice Integration**:
  - Workers as victims too: Extractive economy exploits workers and ecosystems
  - Capital mobility: Timber companies will leave when forest exhausted (workers left behind)
  - Just transition: Retraining, income support, economic diversification for timber workers
  - Solidarity: Environmentalists and workers share interest in sustainable livelihoods
  - Power analysis: Timber corporations pit workers vs. environmentalists (divide and conquer)

- [ ] **Integrated Solutions - Beyond Binary**:
  - **Permanent protection**: Old-growth as protected areas (carbon reserves, biodiversity refugia)
  - **Just transition**: Federal/state support for timber workers (retraining, income support, pensions)
  - **Restoration jobs**: Employment in forest restoration, watershed recovery (long-term work)
  - **Indigenous co-management**: Transfer management authority to indigenous nations
  - **Sustainable harvest**: Second-growth forests managed ecologically (selective harvest, long rotations)
  - **Economic diversification**: Tourism, ecosystem service payments, non-timber forest products
  - **Worker ownership**: Timber cooperatives prioritizing ecological stewardship and living wages

### Evaluation Criteria

- **Domain Accuracy** (0-10): Correct understanding of old-growth ecology, forest carbon, ecosystem services
- **Analytical Depth** (0-10): Thoroughness of ecological, economic, sovereignty, justice analysis
- **Insight Specificity** (0-10): Clear identification of false dilemmas, integrated solutions, leverage points
- **Historical/Contextual Grounding** (0-10): References to forest ecology, timber conflicts, indigenous conservation
- **Reasoning Clarity** (0-10): Logical flow from ecological irreplaceability to justice to integrated solutions

**Minimum Passing Score**: 35/50

## Scenario 5: Plastic Pollution Crisis - From Production to Ocean Gyres

**Event Description**:
Global plastic production reaches 400 million tons annually, with only 9% recycled. Plastic pollution pervades every ecosystem: Ocean garbage patches, microplastics in Arctic ice and deep-sea trenches, plastics in wildlife (seabirds, turtles, whales), microplastics in human blood and placentas. A research expedition documents impacts: 90% of seabirds have ingested plastic, coral reefs entangled in ghost nets, microplastics throughout food webs, and endocrine-disrupting chemicals leaching from plastics. The industry promotes recycling as solution, but recycling infrastructure is inadequate, most plastic is unrecyclable, and recycling itself has environmental costs. Proposed solutions range from individual behavior change (reusable bags) to systemic approaches (production caps, extended producer responsibility, circular economy redesign). Fossil fuel companies invest heavily in plastic production as transportation sector decarbonizes. The crisis exemplifies linear "take-make-dispose" economy, chemical contamination, and corporate externalization of costs.

**Analysis Task**:
Analyze the plastic pollution crisis through systems ecology and circular economy frameworks.

### Expected Analysis Elements

- [ ] **Systems Analysis - Full Lifecycle**:
  - **Extraction**: Fossil fuels (oil, gas) → petrochemicals (environmental destruction at source)
  - **Production**: Energy-intensive, toxic chemical use, worker exposure
  - **Use**: Single-use design, planned obsolescence, disposability culture
  - **Disposal**: Landfill (perpetual waste), incineration (air pollution), ocean dumping
  - **Persistence**: Plastic degrades to microplastics but never fully biodegrades (centuries-millennia)
  - **Bioaccumulation**: Microplastics + toxins accumulate up food chains

- [ ] **Ecological Impacts - Multi-scale**:
  - **Macro-plastics**: Entanglement (fishing gear, six-pack rings), ingestion (blocks digestion, starvation)
  - **Microplastics**: Ingestion throughout food web, cellular-level impacts, gut blockage
  - **Chemical toxicity**: Endocrine disruptors (BPA, phthalates), carcinogens, persistent organic pollutants
  - **Habitat alteration**: Plastic debris creates novel ecosystems ("plastisphere"), alters substrate
  - **Ocean gyres**: Accumulation zones, concentrated toxicity, ecosystem disruption
  - **Terrestrial**: Soil contamination, agricultural impacts, wildlife ingestion

- [ ] **Corporate Responsibility & Greenwashing**:
  - Recycling myth: Industry promotes recycling while designing unrecyclable products
  - Producer responsibility absent: Costs of pollution externalized to society/environment
  - Plastic industry lobbying: Opposes bans, promotes "advanced recycling" (mostly PR)
  - Greenwashing: "Biodegradable plastics" often require industrial composting (unavailable)
  - Growth imperative: Fossil fuel industry shifts to plastics as energy sector declines
  - Chemical industry: Profits from plastic production, not accountable for disposal

- [ ] **Individual Action Critique - Necessary but Insufficient**:
  - Reusable bags/bottles: Helpful but minuscule compared to industrial/commercial plastic
  - Blame shifting: "Personal responsibility" framing deflects from corporate/systemic causes
  - Recycling burden: Consumers expected to sort, clean, transport (industry externalizes labor)
  - Systemic barriers: Many communities lack recycling infrastructure, affordable alternatives
  - Scale mismatch: Individual actions can't solve production-scale problem
  - Value: Individual action as consciousness-raising, cultural shift (but not solution alone)

- [ ] **Circular Economy - Systemic Alternative**:
  - Design for longevity: Durable, repairable products (not single-use)
  - Design for disassembly: Products designed for material recovery
  - Extended Producer Responsibility (EPR): Manufacturers responsible for end-of-life
  - Deposit-refund systems: Economic incentive for return and reuse
  - Material substitution: Biodegradable alternatives where appropriate (caution: not panacea)
  - Reduced consumption: Degrowth, sufficiency, questioning need for disposable culture

- [ ] **Policy Levers - Production to Disposal**:
  - **Production caps**: Limit virgin plastic production (address root cause)
  - **Bans**: Single-use plastics (bags, straws, containers) where alternatives exist
  - **EPR mandates**: Industry funds collection, recycling, disposal infrastructure
  - **Bottle bills**: Deposit systems with high return rates
  - **Procurement**: Government purchasing prioritizes reusable, non-plastic alternatives
  - **Subsidy reform**: End subsidies for fossil fuel/petrochemical industry
  - **Chemical regulation**: Ban endocrine disruptors, toxic additives in plastics
  - **International treaty**: Global agreement on plastic production limits (like Paris for climate)

- [ ] **Environmental Justice Dimensions**:
  - Petrochemical facilities: Disproportionately sited in low-income, minority communities ("Cancer Alley")
  - Waste disposal: Exported to Global South (environmental colonialism)
  - Ocean pollution: Small island nations, coastal communities bear burden
  - Health impacts: Chemical exposure, microplastics affect marginalized communities most
  - Economic: Waste-pickers in informal sector (hazardous work, economic exploitation)
  - Just transition: Workers in plastic industry need support for economic shift

### Evaluation Criteria

- **Domain Accuracy** (0-10): Correct understanding of plastic lifecycle, ecological impacts, circular economy
- **Analytical Depth** (0-10): Thoroughness of systems analysis, corporate critique, policy solutions
- **Insight Specificity** (0-10): Clear identification of root causes, leverage points, systemic alternatives
- **Historical/Contextual Grounding** (0-10): References to plastic pollution research, circular economy, environmental justice
- **Reasoning Clarity** (0-10): Logical flow from lifecycle analysis to systemic critique to transformative solutions
