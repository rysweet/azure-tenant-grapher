## Core Frameworks

### Periodic Table Trends

Understand element behavior from position:

- **Left to right**: Electronegativity increases, atomic radius decreases
- **Top to bottom**: Atomic radius increases, ionization energy decreases
- **Metals**: Left side (conductors, lose electrons)
- **Nonmetals**: Right side (insulators, gain electrons)
- **Noble gases**: Inert, stable electron configuration

### Chemical Bonding

Three main types determine properties:

- **Ionic**: Metal + nonmetal (salt-like, crystalline, high melting point)
- **Covalent**: Nonmetal + nonmetal (molecules, variable melting points)
- **Metallic**: Metal + metal (conductive, malleable, lustrous)

Intermolecular forces (weakest to strongest):

- London dispersion < Dipole-dipole < Hydrogen bonding < Ionic/Covalent

### Thermodynamics (Gibbs Free Energy)

Predicts if reaction is spontaneous:

- **ΔG = ΔH - TΔS**
- **ΔG < 0**: Spontaneous (favorable)
- **ΔG > 0**: Non-spontaneous (unfavorable)
- **ΔG = 0**: At equilibrium

**ΔH** (enthalpy): Negative = exothermic (releases heat), Positive = endothermic (absorbs heat)
**ΔS** (entropy): Positive = increasing disorder (favorable), Negative = increasing order (unfavorable)

### Green Chemistry Principles (Key 6 of 12)

1. **Prevent waste** - Better than cleanup
2. **Atom economy** - Maximize atoms in product
3. **Less hazardous** - Safer chemicals
4. **Energy efficiency** - Ambient conditions preferred
5. **Renewable feedstocks** - Plant-based over petroleum
6. **Design for degradation** - Products break down safely

## Key Concepts

### Functional Groups (Organic Chemistry)

Common groups that determine reactivity:

- **Alcohols** (-OH): Polar, hydrogen bonding, form esters
- **Carboxylic acids** (-COOH): Acidic, form salts and esters
- **Amines** (-NH₂): Basic, nucleophilic
- **Aldehydes/Ketones** (C=O): Reactive carbonyl group
- **Alkenes/Alkynes** (C=C, C≡C): Unsaturated, addition reactions
- **Aromatics** (benzene rings): Stable, substitution reactions

### pH and Acid-Base

- **pH < 7**: Acidic (high H⁺ concentration)
- **pH = 7**: Neutral (pure water)
- **pH > 7**: Basic/alkaline (low H⁺, high OH⁻)
- **Strong acids**: HCl, H₂SO₄, HNO₃ (fully dissociate)
- **Strong bases**: NaOH, KOH (fully dissociate)
- **Buffers**: Resist pH change (weak acid + conjugate base)

### Oxidation-Reduction (Redox)

Electron transfer reactions:

- **Oxidation**: Loss of electrons (increase oxidation state)
- **Reduction**: Gain of electrons (decrease oxidation state)
- **"OIL RIG"**: Oxidation Is Loss, Reduction Is Gain
- Common in batteries, corrosion, metabolism

### Molar Concepts

- **Mole**: 6.02 × 10²³ particles (Avogadro's number)
- **Molar mass**: Grams per mole (from atomic masses)
- **Molarity (M)**: Moles per liter of solution
- **Stoichiometry**: Quantitative relationships in reactions

## Common Patterns

### Pattern: Like Dissolves Like

Polar solvents (water) dissolve polar/ionic compounds. Nonpolar solvents (hexane, oils) dissolve nonpolar compounds. This guides solubility, extraction, and purification.

### Pattern: Structure Determines Reactivity

Functional groups predict reactions. Alcohols can be oxidized to aldehydes/ketones. Amines are basic and nucleophilic. Carbonyls undergo addition reactions.

### Pattern: Thermodynamics vs. Kinetics

Thermodynamics tells you WHERE (equilibrium position). Kinetics tells you HOW FAST you get there. A reaction can be thermodynamically favorable but kinetically slow (needs catalyst or activation).

### Pattern: Green Chemistry Trade-offs

Safer often means different performance. Water-based coatings are greener but may be less durable than solvent-based. Renewable feedstocks may cost more initially. Balance sustainability with function.

## Red Flags

**Safety and Environmental Concerns:**

- Toxic substances (heavy metals, carcinogens, mutagens)
- Persistent organic pollutants (PCBs, DDT, PFAS)
- Ozone-depleting substances (CFCs, halons)
- Greenhouse gases (CO₂, CH₄, SF₆)
- Explosive or highly reactive materials
- Bioaccumulative substances (mercury, PCBs)
- Endocrine disruptors (BPA, phthalates)

**Chemical Red Flags:**

- Mixing incompatible chemicals (acids + cyanides, bleach + ammonia)
- Storing oxidizers with fuels
- Using outdated or banned substances
- Ignoring stereochemistry in pharmaceuticals
- Overlooking reaction exothermicity (thermal runaway risk)
