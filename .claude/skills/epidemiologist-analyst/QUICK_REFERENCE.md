# Epidemiologist Analyst - Quick Reference

## TL;DR

Analyzes disease patterns through epidemiological lens using surveillance, outbreak investigation, and study designs. Quantifies disease occurrence, identifies risk factors, evaluates interventions.

## When to Use

- Disease outbreaks or unusual clusters
- Public health intervention evaluation
- Risk factor and causal analysis
- Surveillance system design or assessment
- Health policy impact evaluation
- Screening program effectiveness

## Core Frameworks

1. **Outbreak Investigation** - CDC 10-step systematic process
2. **Study Designs** - Cohort studies, case-control studies
3. **Disease Measures** - Incidence, prevalence, relative risk, odds ratio
4. **Epidemic Curves** - Point-source, propagated, mixed patterns
5. **Screening Tests** - Sensitivity, specificity, predictive values

## Theoretical Foundations

- **Germ Theory**: Chain of infection, transmission modes
- **Chronic Disease**: Multifactorial causation, prevention levels
- **Causal Inference**: Bradford Hill criteria
- **Surveillance Systems**: Continuous monitoring, early warning
- **Mathematical Modeling**: R₀, SIR/SEIR models, forecasting

## Quick Analysis Process

1. **Define Event** - What disease? Who? Where? When?
2. **Verify Cases** - Confirm diagnosis, create case definition
3. **Describe** - Person, place, time; construct epidemic curve
4. **Generate Hypotheses** - What's the source? How transmitted?
5. **Test Hypotheses** - Cohort or case-control study
6. **Investigate Environment** - Inspect sites, collect samples
7. **Control** - Stop exposure, prevent secondary transmission
8. **Evaluate** - Did interventions work?
9. **Communicate** - Report findings, update guidelines

## Key Questions

- Is this an outbreak or expected variation?
- What is the source and transmission mode?
- Who is at highest risk?
- What's the strength of association (RR, OR)?
- Does exposure precede disease (temporality)?
- Are there alternative explanations (confounding, bias)?
- What control measures are needed immediately?
- Which populations bear disproportionate burden?

## Bradford Hill Causal Criteria

- **Strength**: Strong associations more likely causal
- **Consistency**: Replicated across studies/populations
- **Specificity**: Specific exposure → specific outcome
- **Temporality**: Exposure precedes disease (essential)
- **Biological Gradient**: Dose-response relationship
- **Plausibility**: Biological mechanism makes sense
- **Coherence**: Fits with known biology
- **Experiment**: Intervention changes outcome
- **Analogy**: Similar exposures cause similar effects

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

- Confusing association with causation
- Ignoring selection bias in case-control studies
- Recall bias in retrospective studies
- Misinterpreting epidemic curve patterns
- Inadequate sample size (false negatives)
- Failing to validate surveillance data
- Neglecting time lags and latency periods
- Overlooking ethical considerations

## Essential Data Sources

- **CDC WONDER**: https://wonder.cdc.gov/ (National data)
- **MMWR**: https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/ (Outbreak reports)
- **WHO**: https://www.who.int/ (Global surveillance)
- **State/Local Health Depts**: Reportable diseases

## Study Design Selection

**Cohort Study** when:

- Population well-defined and accessible
- Common exposure
- Short latency disease
- Need incidence measures

**Case-Control Study** when:

- Large or undefined population
- Rare disease
- Long latency
- Need rapid results
- Limited resources

## Key Measures

**Disease Frequency**:

- Incidence = New cases / Population / Time
- Prevalence = Existing cases / Population at time point
- Attack Rate = Cases / Exposed population (outbreak setting)

**Association**:

- Relative Risk (RR) = Incidence₍ₑₓₚₒₛₑ₎ / Incidence₍ᵤₙₑₓₚₒₛₑ₎
- Odds Ratio (OR) = Odds₍ₑₓₚₒₛₑ₎ / Odds₍ᵤₙₑₓₚₒₛₑ₎
- Attributable Risk = Incidence₍ₑₓₚₒₛₑ₎ - Incidence₍ᵤₙₑₓₚₒₛₑ₎

**Screening**:

- Sensitivity = True Positives / (True Positives + False Negatives)
- Specificity = True Negatives / (True Negatives + False Positives)
- PPV = Depends on sensitivity, specificity, AND prevalence

## Success Criteria

✓ Appropriate case definition used
✓ Epidemic curve constructed and interpreted
✓ Quantitative measures calculated (rates, RR, OR)
✓ Study design minimizes bias
✓ Causal assessment rigorous (Bradford Hill)
✓ Control measures evidence-based
✓ Health disparities identified
✓ Timely action during outbreaks
✓ Clear communication to stakeholders
