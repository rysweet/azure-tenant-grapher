# Epidemiologist Analyst Skill

> **Analyze disease patterns and health events through rigorous epidemiological methods to understand distribution, determinants, and control strategies.**

## Overview

The Epidemiologist Analyst skill enables Claude to perform sophisticated disease investigation and population health analysis. Drawing on established epidemiological frameworks, study designs, and evidence-based practices, this skill provides insights into:

- **Disease Surveillance**: Monitoring disease patterns and detecting outbreaks early
- **Outbreak Investigation**: Identifying sources, transmission modes, and control strategies
- **Risk Factor Analysis**: Quantifying associations between exposures and health outcomes
- **Intervention Evaluation**: Assessing effectiveness of prevention and control measures
- **Causal Inference**: Establishing whether observed associations represent causal relationships
- **Health Equity**: Identifying and addressing disparities in disease burden

## What Makes This Different

Unlike general health analysis, epidemiologist analysis:

1. **Population Focus**: Analyzes groups rather than individuals to reveal underlying patterns
2. **Quantitative Precision**: Uses rates, risks, and ratios to measure disease occurrence precisely
3. **Rigorous Causality**: Applies Bradford Hill criteria to distinguish correlation from causation
4. **Prevention Oriented**: Prioritizes interventions that prevent disease occurrence
5. **Evidence-Based**: Grounds conclusions in data from surveillance, studies, and investigations
6. **Time-Sensitive**: Acts rapidly during outbreaks while maintaining methodological rigor

## Use Cases

### Outbreak Investigation

- Foodborne illness clusters requiring rapid source identification
- Healthcare-associated infection outbreaks

## Epidemiological Frameworks Available

### Core Frameworks

- **Outbreak Investigation**: CDC 10-step systematic process from detection to control
- **Study Designs**: Cohort studies, case-control studies, cross-sectional surveys
- **Disease Measures**: Incidence, prevalence, attack rates, relative risk, odds ratios
- **Screening Evaluation**: Sensitivity, specificity, predictive values, ROC curves
- **Epidemic Curves**: Pattern recognition (point-source, propagated, mixed)

### Theoretical Foundations

- **Germ Theory**: Infectious disease transmission and chain of infection
- **Chronic Disease Epidemiology**: Multifactorial causation and prevention levels
- **Causal Inference**: Bradford Hill criteria for establishing causation
- **Disease Surveillance**: Continuous monitoring and early warning systems
- **Mathematical Modeling**: SIR/SEIR models, R₀, epidemic forecasting

### Methodological Approaches

- Disease surveillance (passive, active, syndromic, sentinel, wastewater-based)
- Outbreak investigation following standardized protocols
- Analytic epidemiology (cohort, case-control, ecological studies)
- Mathematical and statistical modeling (compartmental, agent-based, AI-enhanced)
- Screening and prevention program design and evaluation

## Quick Start

### Basic Usage

```
Claude, use the epidemiologist-analyst skill to investigate [HEALTH EVENT].

Examples:
- "Use epidemiologist-analyst to investigate the cluster of gastroenteritis cases at the school."
- "Analyze the vaccination program effectiveness using the epidemiologist-analyst skill."
- "Use epidemiologist skill to evaluate COVID-19 surveillance data quality."
```

### Advanced Usage

Specify particular frameworks or methods:

```
"Use epidemiologist-analyst to investigate the foodborne outbreak using the CDC 10-step
outbreak investigation approach and cohort study design."

"Apply epidemiologist-analyst with case-control methodology to identify risk factors for
this cancer cluster."

"Use epidemiologist-analyst to model COVID-19 transmission dynamics and evaluate
intervention scenarios."
```

## Analysis Process

The epidemiologist analyst follows a systematic 9-step process:

1. **Define Health Event** - Clarify disease, population, geography, and investigation objectives
2. **Verify and Characterize Cases** - Confirm diagnosis, create case definition, conduct case finding
3. **Describe by Person, Place, Time** - Construct epidemic curves, maps, and demographic tables
4. **Generate Hypotheses** - Identify potential sources and transmission modes
5. **Test Hypotheses** - Conduct analytic studies (cohort or case-control)
6. **Environmental Investigation** - Inspect sites, collect samples, perform laboratory testing
7. **Implement Control Measures** - Stop exposure, prevent secondary transmission
8. **Evaluate Effectiveness** - Monitor intervention impact on disease incidence
9. **Communicate Findings** - Report to stakeholders, publish results, update guidelines

## Example Analyses

### Example 1: Norovirus Outbreak at Wedding

**Situation**: 62 of 200 wedding guests develop acute gastroenteritis within 48 hours.

**Analysis Highlights**:

- Epidemic curve shows sharp peak at 24 hours (point-source pattern)
- Cohort study identifies wedding cake as vehicle (RR = 4.8, 95% CI: 1.8-12.7)
- Environmental investigation finds ill pastry chef handled cake without gloves
- Chef stool specimen matches cases (norovirus, same genotype)
- Control measures: staff exclusion policy, handwashing training, glove requirement
- Outcome: No subsequent outbreaks at venue

### Example 2: School HPV Vaccination Program Evaluation

**Situation**: Evaluate new school-entry requirement for HPV vaccination after one year.

**Analysis Highlights**:

- Coverage increased from 42% to 76% (34 percentage point gain)
- Gender gap reduced: females 85%, males 67% (both improved)
- School-based clinics reached 35% of students, critical for uninsured
- Cost-effectiveness: $147 per newly vaccinated student
- Projected impact: Prevent 22 cancers and 4 deaths in this cohort
- Recommendations: Expand clinics to small schools, enhance male-focused education

### Example 3: Long-Term Care COVID-19 Outbreak

**Situation**: 18 residents test positive for COVID-19 in first 5 days.

**Analysis Highlights**:

- Universal testing identifies 32 cases (27 residents, 5 staff)
- Outbreak concentrated in Unit B (60% attack rate)
- Introduced by staff member, rapid spread within unit
- Vaccination reduced attack rates by 50% (25% vs 58% unvaccinated)
- Control measures contained outbreak within 2 weeks
- Recommendations: Staff vaccination mandate, weekly testing, outbreak preparedness

## Common Questions

### When should I use epidemiologist-analyst vs. other analysts?

Use **epidemiologist-analyst** when the question involves:

- Disease patterns, outbreaks, or clusters
- Risk factors and causal relationships
- Population health rather than individual cases
- Prevention strategies and intervention effectiveness
- Surveillance system design or evaluation
- Health disparities and equity

Use **other analysts** when the focus is:

- Molecular disease mechanisms → Biologist
- Clinical diagnosis and treatment → (Clinical focus)
- Health policy politics → Political Scientist
- Individual health behaviors → Psychologist
- Healthcare delivery systems → (Health services focus)

### How does epidemiology differ from clinical medicine?

**Epidemiology**:

- Population focus (groups)
- Prevention oriented
- Rates and risks
- Observational studies common
- Public health practice

**Clinical Medicine**:

- Individual focus (patients)
- Treatment oriented
- Diagnosis and prognosis
- Randomized trials gold standard
- Clinical care

Both collaborate in outbreak investigations and clinical research.

### What if data quality is limited?

Epidemiologists frequently work with imperfect data, especially during outbreaks:

1. **Acknowledge limitations explicitly** in analysis
2. **Use sensitivity analyses** to assess impact of data quality issues
3. **Triangulate** using multiple data sources
4. **Act on best available evidence** during emergencies (don't wait for perfect data)
5. **Refine analysis** as better data becomes available
6. **Improve surveillance** to prevent future data gaps

### How do you balance speed and rigor in outbreak investigations?

Outbreak investigations require both:

- **Rapid preliminary analysis** to implement immediate control measures (don't wait)
- **Rigorous analytic studies** to confirm hypotheses and guide sustained response
- **Iterative process**: Act quickly on strong suspicions, refine as more data emerges
- **Clear communication** about confidence level at each stage

## Integration with Other Skills

Epidemiologist analysis complements:

- **Decision Logger**: Document investigation decisions and rationale
- **Module Spec Generator**: Specify surveillance system modules
- **Philosophy Guardian**: Ensure ruthless simplicity in data collection and analysis
- **Storytelling Synthesizer**: Transform outbreak reports into compelling public health narratives
