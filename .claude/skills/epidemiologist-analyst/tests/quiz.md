# Epidemiologist Analyst - Domain Validation Quiz

## Purpose

This quiz validates that the epidemiologist analyst applies epidemiological methods correctly, identifies disease patterns and risk factors, and provides evidence-based public health analysis. Each scenario requires demonstration of epidemiological reasoning, outbreak investigation, and population health assessment.

## Scenario 1: Novel Respiratory Virus Outbreak

**Event Description**:
A cluster of 47 severe pneumonia cases has emerged in a mid-sized city over 14 days. Initial lab tests rule out common respiratory pathogens (influenza, RSV, common coronaviruses). Patients present with fever, dry cough, and progressive respiratory distress. Five patients have died (case fatality rate: 10.6%). Cases include healthcare workers (6 cases), market vendors (12 cases), and family contacts (8 cases). No clear animal source identified yet. Local hospitals report ICU capacity at 85%. Public concern is mounting, with social media spreading both accurate information and unfounded conspiracy theories.

## Scenario 2: Foodborne Disease Outbreak

**Event Description**:
Over 72 hours, 143 people in a metropolitan area report acute gastroenteritis (diarrhea, vomiting, abdominal cramps, fever). Cases range from ages 8 to 76. Symptom onset is clustered between 12-36 hours after a large community festival where 50+ food vendors operated. Fifteen patients are hospitalized for dehydration. Preliminary interviews reveal cases ate from multiple vendors, but 78% consumed items from a specific food truck serving raw oysters and ceviche. The food truck operator reports sourcing oysters from a new supplier. No other outbreaks reported from that supplier's distribution network yet.

**Analysis Task**:
Investigate the outbreak and identify control measures.

A county with historically low vaccination rates (MMR vaccine coverage: 67% among kindergarteners vs. 95% state average) reports 38 confirmed measles cases over 6 weeks. The index case was an unvaccinated 7-year-old who traveled internationally. Secondary cases include 12 children under 1 year (too young for MMR), 18 unvaccinated school-age children, 4 vaccinated individuals (vaccine failure), and 4 adults with unknown vaccination status. Fifteen cases required hospitalization; one infant developed encephalitis. The outbreak began in a private school with vaccine exemption rate of 28%, then spread to the broader community through a pediatric clinic waiting room.

## Scenario 4: Healthcare-Associated Infection Cluster

**Event Description**:
A hospital's infection control team identifies 9 patients who developed bloodstream infections with carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae (CRE) over 4 weeks. All patients were in the intensive care unit (ICU), had central venous catheters, and received mechanical ventilation. Whole genome sequencing confirms all isolates are genetically identical, indicating a common source. Environmental cultures detect CRE on ultrasound gel and multi-use bottles in the ICU. Review of practices reveals inconsistent hand hygiene, shared equipment without adequate disinfection, and medication preparation in patient care areas. The ICU has been operating at 110% capacity due to seasonal influenza surge.

## Scenario 5: Environmental Health Crisis

**Event Description**:
A community of 8,500 residents near a former industrial site reports elevated rates of childhood leukemia. Over 5 years, 23 cases of acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) in children under 15 were diagnosed, compared to an expected 6 cases based on state rates (standardized incidence ratio: 3.8, p<0.01). Environmental testing reveals soil and groundwater contamination with benzene, trichloroethylene (TCE), and heavy metals from decades of improper waste disposal. Private wells used by 40% of residents show contamination above EPA safe limits. A retrospective cohort study finds elevated leukemia risk associated with well water consumption duration and proximity to contamination sites. Community members report distrust of government authorities due to delayed disclosure of contamination data.

**Analysis Task**:
Analyze the cancer cluster and recommend public health interventions.

### Expected Analysis Elements
