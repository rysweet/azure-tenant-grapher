# Socratic Code Review

You are initiating a Socratic code review session. Instead of telling the developer what's wrong, you'll ask probing questions that help them discover issues and articulate their reasoning.

## When to Use This Skill

Use Socratic review when:

- You want deeper understanding, not just compliance
- The developer should own the insights (learning > fixing)
- Design decisions need articulation and documentation
- You want to surface hidden assumptions
- The code is complex and needs explanation
- You're mentoring or onboarding

Use traditional review when:

- Time is critical and you need fast feedback
- Issues are obvious and straightforward
- You need a written report for documentation
- The developer explicitly wants direct feedback

## Usage

```bash
# Basic usage - reviews file with standard depth (7-10 questions)
/socratic-review path/to/file.py

# Quick review - 3-5 focused questions
/socratic-review path/to/file.py --depth=quick

# Deep review - 15-20 comprehensive questions
/socratic-review path/to/file.py --depth=deep

# Review specific function/class
/socratic-review path/to/file.py --focus="function_name"

# Review a directory
/socratic-review src/auth/

# Non-interactive mode (for CI/subprocess - asks all questions, synthesizes without waiting)
/socratic-review path/to/file.py --non-interactive

# Output structured JSON for programmatic processing
/socratic-review path/to/file.py --non-interactive --output=review.json

# Write insights to DECISIONS.md
/socratic-review path/to/file.py --write-decisions
```

## How It Works

### 1. Context Analysis

First, I'll analyze the code to understand:
- What files/functions are being reviewed
- Complexity level and patterns used
- Areas that warrant deeper questions

### 2. Question Selection

Based on the code, I'll select questions from six categories:
- **Design**: Why was this approach chosen?
- **Edge Cases**: What happens in unusual situations?
- **Clarity**: How would you explain this?
- **Philosophy**: Does this follow project principles?
- **Failure Modes**: What could go wrong?
- **Testing**: How do you know it works?

### 3. Dialogue

I'll ask questions one at a time and wait for your responses:

```
**Q1** [Category: Design]
Why did you choose to store session data in memory rather than a database?

[WAIT FOR YOUR RESPONSE]
```

After each answer, I may:
- Ask a follow-up question if the answer reveals uncertainty
- Move to the next question if understanding is solid
- Note insights for the final synthesis

### 4. Synthesis

After all questions, I'll summarize:
- **Insights Revealed**: What became clear through dialogue
- **Assumptions Surfaced**: Hidden assumptions that were exposed
- **Recommendations**: What should change based on the dialogue
- **Strengths**: What you clearly understood well

## Depth Levels

### Quick (3-5 questions, ~5 min)

Best for:
- Small bug fixes
- Simple changes
- Obvious code

Focus: Highest-risk areas only

### Standard (7-10 questions, ~15 min)

Best for:
- Feature implementations
- Refactoring
- Typical PRs

Focus: All question categories covered

### Deep (15-20 questions, ~30 min)

Best for:
- Security-sensitive code
- Core infrastructure
- Architectural changes

Focus: Comprehensive with follow-ups

## Example Session

```markdown
## Socratic Review: auth/login.py

I'm going to ask you some questions about this login implementation.
There are no wrong answers - the goal is to think through the design together.

---

**Q1** [Category: Design]
I see you're storing session data in an in-memory dictionary.
Why did you choose this approach over Redis or database storage?

> Your answer: "It was simpler to implement and we don't have many users yet."

That makes sense for simplicity. **Follow-up**: What would trigger you to
migrate to a different storage mechanism?

> Your answer: "Um... I guess when we scale? Or add multiple servers?"

**Insight noted**: Migration criteria aren't clearly defined.

---

**Q2** [Category: Edge Case]
What happens if a user's session expires while they're submitting a form?

> Your answer: "I... actually haven't thought about that."

**Insight noted**: Session timeout during active use is unhandled.

## Review Synthesis

### Insights Revealed
- Session storage is pragmatic but migration path unclear
- Session timeout during active use is unhandled

### Assumptions Surfaced
- Single server deployment assumption
- Users won't have long form submissions

### Recommendations
1. Document session storage migration criteria
2. Add graceful session timeout handling

### Strengths Identified
- Clear awareness of simplicity trade-offs
- Quick recognition of gaps when prompted
```

## Integration with Workflow

Socratic review can replace standard review at Step 11 of DEFAULT_WORKFLOW:

```markdown
Step 11: Review the Code

Choose review approach:
A) Standard review - Direct feedback from reviewer agent
B) Socratic review - Dialogue with socratic-reviewer agent

Use Socratic when:
- Learning is as important as fixing
- Design decisions need documentation
- Mentoring/onboarding context
```

## Tips for Good Responses

When answering questions:

1. **Be specific**: "It handles null by returning empty array" is better than "It should be fine"
2. **Acknowledge uncertainty**: "I'm not sure what happens" is valuable - it reveals gaps
3. **Think out loud**: Explain your reasoning, not just the answer
4. **Ask for clarification**: If a question is unclear, say so

## Feedback Loop: How Insights Return

The key question: how do insights from dialogue become actual improvements?

### Interactive Mode (Default)

During live dialogue:
1. Each question and response is captured
2. Insights are noted inline
3. At the end, a synthesis is produced
4. You can use `--write-decisions` to persist insights to DECISIONS.md

### Non-Interactive Mode (CI/Subprocess)

For automated contexts:
1. All questions are asked rhetorically
2. Agent analyzes code to identify likely issues
3. Structured JSON output is produced
4. Output can be posted to PR comments automatically

**Auto-Detection:** The skill automatically detects non-interactive contexts (e.g., `claude --print`, CI pipelines, no TTY) and switches to non-interactive mode. This prevents the frustrating pattern of asking questions, waiting for responses that can't come, and exiting INCONCLUSIVE with no useful output.

### Posting to PR

```bash
# Run non-interactive review
/socratic-review src/auth/ --non-interactive --output=review.json

# Post results to PR
gh pr comment 123 --body "$(jq -r '.synthesis | "## Socratic Review\n\n### Insights\n" + (.insights_revealed | map("- " + .) | join("\n")) + "\n\n### Recommendations\n" + (.recommendations | map("- [" + .priority + "] " + .description) | join("\n"))' review.json)"
```

### Exit on Inconclusive

If 3 questions go unanswered in interactive mode, the session exits with `INCONCLUSIVE` status. Socratic review requires willing participation - without it, exit cleanly rather than pretend to do something else. The user can then choose to run traditional `/review` instead.

## What This Is NOT

- **Not a test**: There are no wrong answers
- **Not criticism**: Questions explore, not judge
- **Not a checklist**: Questions adapt to your code and answers
- **Not replacement for tests**: This is for understanding, not verification

## Underlying Philosophy

This skill is based on:

1. **Feynman Technique**: Teaching reveals gaps in understanding
2. **Socratic Method**: Questions create deeper insight than answers
3. **Rubber Duck Debugging**: Explaining forces thoroughness
4. **Pair Programming**: Dialogue catches what solo work misses

## Related

- **Agent**: `~/.amplihack/.claude/agents/amplihack/specialized/socratic-reviewer.md`
- **Traditional Review**: `/reviewing-code` skill for direct feedback
- **Philosophy Check**: `philosophy-guardian` agent for compliance

## Execution

When this skill is invoked:

1. Parse arguments (file path, depth level, focus)
2. Read and analyze the target code
3. Invoke the socratic-reviewer agent with context
4. Facilitate the dialogue, waiting for user responses
5. Synthesize findings at the end

```
Task(
  subagent_type="socratic-reviewer",
  prompt="Conduct Socratic review of [file] at [depth] level. Focus on: [areas]"
)
```

The agent will handle the question flow and wait for responses using [WAIT] markers.
