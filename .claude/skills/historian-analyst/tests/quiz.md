## Scenario 1: Revolutionary Crisis and Regime Collapse

**Event Description**:
A long-standing authoritarian regime faces a revolutionary crisis. Contributing factors: 30 years of economic stagnation with wealth concentration among elites; recent poor harvests causing food price spikes; intellectual ferment with banned books circulating underground; a humiliating military defeat revealing regime incompetence; younger generation of reformist officials pushing for change; traditional elites divided between hardliners and moderates. Triggering event: Regime violently suppresses peaceful demonstration, killing 50 protesters. Subsequent days see massive strikes, military defections, and provincial governors declaring neutrality. The regime oscillates between repression and concessions, while revolutionaries debate whether to accept reforms or demand total regime change. International powers watch nervously, some considering intervention.

**Analysis Task**:
Analyze this revolutionary crisis using historical frameworks and predict potential trajectories.

### Expected Analysis Elements

- [ ] **Revolutionary Theory Application**:
  - Crane Brinton's stages: Financial crisis, desertion of intellectuals, dual sovereignty, reign of terror, Thermidor
  - Skocpol's structural conditions: State crisis, elite division, peasant/popular mobilization
  - Tilly's revolutionary situations: Multiple sovereignty, polarization, state breakdown
  - Pre-revolutionary vs. revolutionary vs. post-revolutionary phases

- [ ] **Causal Analysis**:
  - Structural causes (long-term): Economic stagnation, social contradictions, ideological erosion
  - Medium-term precipitants: Military defeat, elite divisions, reform attempts
  - Triggers: Violent repression of protest (radicalizing effect)
  - Contingency: Could crisis have been avoided? Alternative paths?

- [ ] **Actor Analysis**:
  - Regime: Hardliners vs. moderates, coercive capacity, legitimacy deficit
  - Revolutionaries: Moderate reformers vs. radicals, organizational capacity
  - Military: Defection risk, loyalty factors, corporate interests
  - International: Intervention precedents, geopolitical interests

- [ ] **Historical Parallels**:
  - French Revolution (1789): Similar structural conditions, radicalization trajectory
  - Russian Revolution (1917): Military defeat, dual power, Bolshevik radicalization
  - Iranian Revolution (1979): Coalition fracture, clerical takeover
  - Revolutions of 1989: Elite negotiation vs. mass mobilization paths
  - Arab Spring (2011): Regional diffusion, diverse outcomes

- [ ] **Trajectory Assessment**:
  - **Regime survival through repression**: Requires military loyalty, examples (China 1989, Syria 2011)
  - **Negotiated transition**: Elite pact, examples (South Africa, Poland)
  - **Radical revolution**: Old regime collapse, examples (France, Russia, Iran)
  - **Civil war**: Stalemate, examples (Libya, Syria)
  - Contingency factors determining path

- [ ] **Historiographical Awareness**:
  - Great man vs. structural theories
  - Intentionalist vs. functionalist explanations
  - Teleology avoidance (outcome not predetermined)
  - Counterfactual reasoning (what if military stayed loyal?)

## Scenario 2: Imperial Decline and Succession Crisis

**Event Description**:
A vast multi-ethnic empire spanning three continents faces succession crisis after the sudden death of the emperor (age 52, unexpected illness). Context: The empire expanded rapidly over 150 years through conquest and dynastic marriages, but recent decades show signs of overextension: costly wars on multiple frontiers, provincial revolts, fiscal crisis from military spending, bureaucratic corruption, religious tensions between orthodox center and heterodox peripheries. The late emperor left no clear heir: eldest son (age 28) is militarily inexperienced but has support of central bureaucracy; younger son (age 24) is a successful general with army loyalty but mistrusted by civilian elites; emperor's brother claims regency rights; powerful provincial governors sense opportunity for autonomy. Economic strain: Debased currency, tax collection inefficiency, merchant class unhappy with trade disruptions.

**Analysis Task**:
Analyze the succession crisis and the empire's prospects using historical patterns of imperial decline.

### Expected Analysis Elements

- [ ] **Imperial Decline Framework**:
  - Paul Kennedy's "imperial overstretch": Military commitments exceed resources
  - Ibn Khaldun's "asabiyyah" (group solidarity) erosion over generations
  - Fiscal-military state crisis: War costs exceed extraction capacity
  - Periphery-center dynamics: Provincial autonomy vs. central control

- [ ] **Succession Crisis Patterns**:
  - Primogeniture vs. merit vs. election succession rules
  - Military vs. bureaucratic vs. hereditary legitimacy claims
  - Civil war risk when succession rules unclear
  - Precedents: Roman civil wars, Ottoman interregnums, Chinese dynastic transitions

- [ ] **Multi-Ethnic Empire Dynamics**:
  - Ethnic hierarchy and resentment (core vs. periphery)
  - Religious pluralism management
  - Provincial governors as potential breakaway states
  - Precedents: Habsburgs, Ottomans, Qing China, Mughals

- [ ] **Fiscal-Military Crisis**:
  - Military spending → debased currency → inflation → tax revenue decline
  - Vicious cycle: Weakness invites attack → more military spending
  - Inability to pay army → mutiny or defection risk
  - Precedents: Ming China, Spanish Empire, Rome (3rd century)

- [ ] **Comparative Imperial Trajectories**:
  - **Reform and survival**: Ottoman Tanzimat, Qing Self-Strengthening (temporary stabilization)
  - **Fragmentation**: Abbasid Caliphate, Carolingian Empire (provincial autonomy → breakup)
  - **Conquest by outsiders**: Byzantium (Ottoman conquest), Mughals (British)
  - **Revolution from within**: Russian Empire (1917), Qing (1911)

- [ ] **Historiographical Considerations**:
  - Decline narratives: Cyclical vs. linear, teleology dangers
  - Agency vs. structure: Could reform have worked?
  - Eurocentrism in decline theories
  - Periodization: When did "decline" begin? (retrospective framing)

### Evaluation Criteria

- **Domain Accuracy** (0-10): Correct application of imperial decline theory, succession patterns
- **Analytical Depth** (0-10): Thoroughness of fiscal, ethnic, military analysis
- **Insight Specificity** (0-10): Clear trajectory assessment with comparative reasoning

## Scenario 3: Industrial Revolution Social Transformation

**Event Description**:
A society undergoes rapid industrialization over 50 years. Initial conditions: 85% rural agrarian population, feudal land tenure, guild-controlled craft production, limited literacy, weak central state. Changes: Steam-powered factories emerge in textile and iron production; rural-to-urban migration creates industrial cities (population growth from 50,000 to 500,000 in major cities); factory system replaces artisanal production; child labor becomes widespread; working conditions are harsh (12-14 hour days, unsafe); wages are low but higher than rural subsistence; traditional family structures strain; new social classes emerge (industrial bourgeoisie, urban proletariat); environmental degradation (air and water pollution); ideological ferment (liberalism, socialism, nationalism). Responses: Luddite machine-breaking, early trade union formation, middle-class reform movements, conservative backlash defending tradition, government minimal intervention (laissez-faire ideology), some factory acts regulating child labor.

**Analysis Task**:
Analyze the social transformation and predict long-term consequences using historical frameworks.

### Expected Analysis Elements

- [ ] **Industrial Revolution Framework**:
  - Technological innovation: Steam power, mechanization, factory system
  - Capital accumulation and investment patterns
  - Labor transformation: Proletarianization, deskilling, work discipline

  - Reform movements: Factory acts, sanitation, education
  - Radical challenges: Chartism, socialism, anarchism
  - Conservative reaction: Romanticism, tradition defense

- [ ] **Long-Term Trajectory**:
  - Welfare state emergence (Bismarckian social insurance, British reforms)
  - Labor movement institutionalization (trade unions, social democratic parties)
  - Democratic expansion (working-class suffrage)
  - Modern economic growth takeoff

## Scenario 4: Epidemic and Societal Response in Pre-Modern Context

**Event Description**:
A deadly epidemic spreads across a region in a pre-modern society (limited medical knowledge, no germ theory). The disease: High mortality rate (30-40% of infected), spreads rapidly through trade routes and densely populated areas, symptoms include fever and visible sores (generating fear and stigma). Timeline: First cases appear in a port city; within 6 months spreads to capital and major towns; within 18 months reaches rural areas. Responses: Initial denial and panic; religious explanations dominate (divine punishment, evil spirits); authorities implement quarantines and travel restrictions (inconsistently enforced); persecution of marginalized groups blamed for outbreak (foreigners, religious minorities, beggars); flight of elites from cities; economic disruption (labor shortages, harvest failures, trade collapse); some areas see breakdown of social order (looting, abandonment of sick); others see charitable mobilization; physicians propose humoral explanations, recommend bloodletting and herbal remedies (ineffective); demographic impact: 25% population mortality in worst-hit areas.

**Analysis Task**:
Analyze the epidemic's impact and responses using historical frameworks for understanding disease in pre-modern societies.

### Expected Analysis Elements

- [ ] **Historical Epidemiology**:
  - Disease diffusion patterns: Trade routes, urban density, seasonality
  - Demographic impact: Age-selective mortality, differential urban/rural impact
  - Economic consequences: Labor scarcity → wage changes (survivors benefit?)
  - Comparison: Black Death, Justinianic Plague, smallpox in Americas

- [ ] **Medical Knowledge Context**:
  - Pre-germ theory paradigms: Miasma theory, humoral medicine, divine causation
  - Ineffective interventions with internal logic
  - Quarantine as empirical observation (pre-understanding contagion)
  - Historiography: Retrospective diagnosis challenges

- [ ] **Social and Cultural Responses**:
  - Scapegoating and persecution (precedents: Black Death Jewish pogroms, plague poisoning accusations)
  - Religious interpretations: Sin and punishment, apocalypticism, flagellant movements
  - Charitable responses: Religious orders, civic duty
  - Social breakdown vs. solidarity (varies by context)

- [ ] **Political and Economic Effects**:
  - State capacity test: Can authorities enforce quarantine?
  - Fiscal crisis: Tax revenue decline, increased emergency spending
  - Labor market transformation: Scarcity → higher wages → erosion of serfdom? (Black Death precedent)
  - Elite legitimacy: Failure to protect → political consequences

- [ ] **Long-Term Consequences**:
  - Demographic recovery timeline (generations)
  - Economic restructuring: Labor-land ratio shifts
  - Cultural trauma and memory (art, literature, ritual)
  - Institutional changes: Public health precedents, state expansion

- [ ] **Historiographical Issues**:
  - Quantification challenges: Incomplete records, estimation methods
  - Retrospective diagnosis: Identifying historical diseases with modern epidemiology
  - Agency and contingency: Why did some communities fare better?
  - Comparative framework: Universal patterns vs. context-specific responses

### Evaluation Criteria

- **Domain Accuracy** (0-10): Correct application of historical epidemiology, pre-modern medical context
- **Analytical Depth** (0-10): Thoroughness of demographic, economic, social, political analysis
- **Insight Specificity** (0-10): Clear causal mechanisms and long-term consequences
- **Historical Grounding** (0-10): Rich comparative examples (Black Death, etc.), historiographical awareness
- **Reasoning Clarity** (0-10): Logical analysis, avoidance of presentism (not judging by modern standards)

**Minimum Passing Score**: 35/50

## Scenario 5: Decolonization and Nation-State Formation

**Event Description**:
A colonial power withdraws from a large overseas colony after 120 years of rule. Context: The colony was economically valuable (cash crop exports, mineral extraction) but became costly to maintain due to rising nationalist resistance, international pressure (UN decolonization norms), and domestic war fatigue in the metropole. Colonial legacy: Artificial borders cutting across ethnic and linguistic groups; export-oriented economy with limited industrialization; small Western-educated elite; large peasant majority; uneven development (coastal areas vs. interior); authoritarian colonial governance with no democratic institutions; multiple ethnic groups with one comprising 45% (dominant in capital), two others 30% and 20%, plus smaller minorities; religious divisions (introduced Christianity, traditional religions, some Islam). Decolonization process: Rushed (18 months from announcement to independence); minimal preparation; power transferred to nationalist party that led independence struggle (dominated by largest ethnic group); constitution promises democracy and equal citizenship; boundaries remain unchanged.

**Analysis Task**:
Analyze the challenges of post-colonial nation-state formation and predict likely trajectories.

### Expected Analysis Elements

- [ ] **Decolonization Framework**:
  - Modes of decolonization: Negotiated vs. violent, rapid vs. gradual
  - Colonial legacy analysis: Institutional, economic, social
  - Artificial boundaries and ethnic heterogeneity problems
  - Comparison: India/Pakistan, African decolonization, Southeast Asia

- [ ] **Nation-State Building Challenges**:
  - Gellner/Anderson: Nationalism requires shared identity, but colonial borders arbitrary
  - State capacity deficit: Limited infrastructure, bureaucracy, legitimacy
  - Ethnic politics: Majoritarian vs. pluralist nation-building
  - Language policy: Colonial language vs. indigenous languages (divisive choice)

- [ ] **Economic Challenges**:
  - Dependency theory: Inherited export economy, limited autonomy
  - Import-substitution industrialization (ISI) vs. continued commodity export
  - Infrastructure bias (colonial extraction routes, not national integration)
  - Human capital deficit: Limited education, technical skills

- [ ] **Political Trajectories**:
  - **Democratic consolidation**: Requires institutions, but many lack (rare outcome)
  - **Authoritarianism**: One-party state, military rule (common pattern)
  - **Ethnic conflict**: Majoritarianism alienates minorities → civil war (Nigeria, Sudan)
  - **State failure**: Capacity collapse, warlordism (Somalia, Congo)
  - Contingency factors: Leadership, external support, resource curse

- [ ] **Comparative Cases**:
  - **Relative success**: Botswana (institutions, homogeneity, resources managed well), Tanzania (Nyerere's ujamaa)
  - **Ethnic conflict**: Nigeria (Biafra war), Sudan, Rwanda, Sri Lanka
  - **Authoritarianism**: Most post-colonial states (Mobutu's Zaire, various military regimes)
  - **Partition precedent**: India/Pakistan (violence, refugee crisis)

- [ ] **Historiographical Perspectives**:
  - Dependency theory vs. modernization theory
  - Postcolonial critique: Agency of colonized, hybridity
  - Path dependence: How much does colonial legacy determine trajectory?
  - Counterfactuals: Different borders, different decolonization timing?

### Evaluation Criteria

- **Domain Accuracy** (0-10): Correct application of decolonization theory, nation-building frameworks
- **Analytical Depth** (0-10): Thoroughness of political, economic, ethnic analysis
- **Insight Specificity** (0-10): Clear trajectory assessment with contingency factors
- **Historical Grounding** (0-10): Rich comparative cases, historiographical engagement
- **Reasoning Clarity** (0-10): Logical causal analysis, avoidance of teleology

**Minimum Passing Score**: 35/50
