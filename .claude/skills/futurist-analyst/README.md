# Futurist Analyst Skill

> **Analyze events through the lens of futures studies and strategic foresight to identify trends, anticipate change, and prepare for multiple possible futures.**

## Overview

The Futurist Analyst skill enables Claude to perform sophisticated futures analysis, applying established forecasting frameworks, scenario planning methods, and systems thinking. Drawing on strategic foresight methodologies and anticipatory techniques, this skill provides insights into:

- **Emerging Trends**: Identifying and analyzing patterns of change
- **Weak Signals**: Detecting early indicators of future developments
- **Scenario Planning**: Exploring multiple plausible futures
- **Drivers of Change**: STEEP analysis (Social, Technological, Economic, Environmental, Political)
- **Strategic Foresight**: Preparing for uncertainty and building resilience
- **Three Horizons**: Understanding present, transitional, and emerging systems

## What Makes This Different

Unlike general analysis, futurist analysis:

1. **Explores Multiple Futures**: Scenarios instead of single predictions
2. **Applies Systematic Frameworks**: Three horizons, scenario planning, STEEP analysis
3. **Detects Weak Signals**: Early indicators at edges and margins
4. **Embraces Uncertainty**: Prepares for unknowns rather than claiming certainty
5. **Systems Thinking**: Interconnections, feedback loops, cascading effects
6. **Long-term Perspective**: 5-30 year horizons, intergenerational thinking

## Use Cases

### Strategic Planning

- Long-term planning under uncertainty
- Preparing for multiple scenarios
- Building robust strategies

## Futures Frameworks Available

### Core Frameworks

- **Three Horizons**: Present (H1) → Transition (H2) → Emerging (H3)
- **Scenario Planning**: Develop 2-4 plausible futures based on critical uncertainties
- **STEEP/PESTLE**: Systematic scanning of change drivers
- **Futures Cone**: Range from probable to possible to preposterous futures

### Forecasting Methods

- **Exploratory**: Project forward from present (what could happen?)
- **Normative/Backcasting**: Work backward from desired future (what should happen?)
- **Delphi Method**: Systematic expert consultation and consensus
- **Trend Extrapolation**: S-curves, adoption patterns, inflection points
- **Cross-Impact Analysis**: How trends and events affect each other

### Strategic Tools

- **Wind Tunneling**: Test strategies across scenarios
- **Monitoring Systems**: Early indicators and trigger points
- **Causal Layered Analysis**: Surface → systemic → worldview → myth levels
- **Pre-Mortem**: Anticipate failure modes before they occur

### Signal Detection

- **Weak Signals**: Early indicators of change at margins
- **Wild Cards**: Low probability, high impact events
- **Leading Indicators**: Signs of which future is emerging
- **Pattern Recognition**: Connecting dots across domains

## Quick Start

### Basic Usage

```
Claude, use the futurist-analyst skill to analyze [TREND/TECHNOLOGY/CHANGE].

Examples:
- "Use futurist-analyst to explore the future of remote work."
- "Analyze renewable energy transition scenarios using futurist-analyst."
- "Use the futurist skill to identify weak signals in healthcare."
```

### Advanced Usage

Specify particular frameworks or time horizons:

```
"Use futurist-analyst with scenario planning to explore AI futures over 15 years."

"Apply futurist-analyst with three horizons framework to understand energy transition."

"Use futurist-analyst to identify weak signals and wildcards for financial services."
```

## Analysis Process

The futurist analyst follows a systematic 10-step process:

1. **Define Focal Question** - Clarify issue, time horizon, stakeholders
2. **Scan for Drivers (STEEP)** - Social, technological, economic, environmental, political trends
3. **Identify Critical Uncertainties** - High impact, high uncertainty factors
4. **Develop Scenarios** - 2-4 plausible, distinct futures based on uncertainties
5. **Analyze Three Horizons** - Present, transitional, emerging systems
6. **Identify Weak Signals** - Early indicators at edges, wildcards
7. **Wind Tunnel Strategies** - Test options across scenarios, identify robust strategies
8. **Develop Monitoring** - Early indicators, trigger points for each scenario
9. **Identify Strategic Options** - Robust, hedging, shaping, adaptive strategies
10. **Synthesize Insights** - Integrate findings, acknowledge uncertainty, communicate

## Example Analyses

### Example 1: Future of Work with AI

**Focal Question**: How will work evolve over 15 years with AI advancement?

**Critical Uncertainties**:

- AI advancement rate (slow vs. fast)
- Societal response (adaptive vs. resistant)

**Four Scenarios**:

- **Gradual Evolution**: Slow AI + Adaptive society → smooth transition
- **Disruption and Adjustment**: Fast AI + Adaptive society → bold policies, UBI
- **Stagnation and Inequality**: Slow AI + Resistant society → protected jobs, reduced competitiveness
- **Turbulent Transformation**: Fast AI + Resistant society → mass unemployment, unrest

**Weak Signals**: AI agents in complex tasks, 4-day week pilots, UBI experiments, skills-based hiring

**Robust Strategy**: Human-AI collaboration + proactive policy engagement + organizational adaptability

### Example 2: Renewable Energy Transition

**Focal Question**: Pace and scale of renewable replacement by 2040

**Scenarios**:

- **Steady Progress**: Incremental tech + Weak politics → 50-60% renewable
- **Green Acceleration**: Incremental tech + Strong politics → 70-80% renewable
- **Breakthrough Stagnation**: Transformative tech + Weak politics → potential unrealized
- **Rapid Transformation**: Transformative tech + Strong politics → 90%+ renewable

**Early Indicators**: Battery costs, policy ambition, carbon pricing, investment flows

**Strategy**: Aggressive renewable investment + policy advocacy + technology optionality

### Example 3: Precision Medicine

**Focal Question**: How will precision medicine transform healthcare by 2035?

**Scenarios**:

- **Precision for Some**: Fragmented data + Limited access → inequality deepens
- **Universal Precision**: Integrated data + Widespread access → broad benefit
- **Data-Rich, Benefit-Poor**: Integrated data + Limited access → unrealized potential
- **Fragmented Innovation**: Fragmented data + Widespread access → inconsistent results

**Strategy**: Build capabilities + advocate for data integration + support equity
