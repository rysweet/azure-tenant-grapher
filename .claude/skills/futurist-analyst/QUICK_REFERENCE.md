# Futurist Analyst - Quick Reference

## TL;DR

Analyzes events through futures lens using scenario planning, trend analysis, and weak signals to explore multiple plausible futures and prepare for uncertainty.

## When to Use

- Strategic planning under uncertainty
- Emerging trend identification
- Technology assessment and impacts
- Long-term risk and opportunity
- Scenario planning and preparation
- Innovation strategy and foresight

## Core Frameworks

1. **Three Horizons** - H1 (present/dominant) → H2 (transition/disruptive) → H3 (emerging/future)
2. **Scenario Planning** - Develop 2-4 plausible futures based on critical uncertainties
3. **STEEP Analysis** - Social, Technological, Economic, Environmental, Political drivers
4. **Weak Signals** - Early indicators at edges and margins

## Scenario Planning Method

1. **Focal Question** - What decision/issue? What time horizon?
2. **Driving Forces** - What trends/uncertainties shape future?
3. **Critical Uncertainties** - 2-3 high impact, high uncertainty factors
4. **Scenario Development** - Create distinct, plausible futures
5. **Strategy Testing** - Wind tunnel strategies across scenarios
6. **Monitoring** - Early indicators for each scenario

## Quick Analysis Process

1. **Define Focal Question** - Issue, time horizon, stakeholders
2. **Scan Drivers (STEEP)** - Identify forces of change
3. **Identify Uncertainties** - High impact + high uncertainty
4. **Develop Scenarios** - 2-4 plausible, distinct futures
5. **Analyze Horizons** - H1 (present) → H2 (transition) → H3 (emerging)
6. **Spot Weak Signals** - Early indicators, wildcards
7. **Test Strategies** - What works across scenarios?
8. **Monitor Indicators** - Which future is emerging?

## Key Questions

- What is changing? In what direction? How fast?
- What's uncertain? What could go very differently?
- What weak signals are emerging at edges?
- What are plausible futures (not THE future)?
- What strategies work across scenarios?
- What early indicators tell us which future is emerging?
- What wildcards could disrupt?

## Common Pitfalls

- **Prediction trap**: Trying to predict instead of exploring
- **Trend extrapolation**: Assuming linear continuation
- **Present-mindedness**: Projecting present assumptions onto future
- **Single scenario**: Preparing for one future only
- **Ignoring weak signals**: Focusing only on mainstream
- **Technology determinism**: Assuming tech alone determines futures
