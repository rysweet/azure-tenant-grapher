# Gang of Four Design Patterns Expert

Comprehensive knowledge of all 23 GoF design patterns with progressive disclosure and philosophy-aligned guidance.

## Quick Start

This skill auto-activates when you mention:

- Pattern names (Factory Method, Observer, Strategy, etc.)
- "design pattern", "which pattern should I use"
- Problems needing structural solutions
- Pattern categories (creational, structural, behavioral)

## What It Provides

- **Tier 1**: Instant quick reference (always inline)
- **Tier 2**: Practical guide with code (on request)
- **Tier 3**: Deep dive with multi-language examples (on explicit request)

## Philosophy

This skill follows amplihack's ruthless simplicity - it helps you decide if patterns are appropriate, not encourage their use.

**Key Principles**:

- Start with simplest solution that works
- YAGNI: Don't add patterns "for future flexibility"
- Patterns need ≥2 actual use cases RIGHT NOW
- Warns against over-engineering

## Example Queries

```
"What is the Observer pattern?"              → Tier 1 quick reference
"How to implement Strategy?"                 → Tier 2 with code
"Which pattern for notifying multiple?"      → Pattern recognition
"Factory Method vs Abstract Factory?"        → Comparison
"Should I use Singleton?"                    → Philosophy check (warns!)
"Deep dive into Decorator"                   → Tier 3 comprehensive
```

## Pattern Coverage

**All 23 GoF Patterns**:

- 5 Creational: Factory Method, Abstract Factory, Builder, Prototype, Singleton
- 7 Structural: Adapter, Bridge, Composite, Decorator, Facade, Flyweight, Proxy
- 11 Behavioral: Chain of Responsibility, Command, Interpreter, Iterator, Mediator, Memento, Observer, State, Strategy, Template Method, Visitor

## Code Examples

- **Python**: All 23 patterns
- **TypeScript & Java**: Top 10 most-used patterns
