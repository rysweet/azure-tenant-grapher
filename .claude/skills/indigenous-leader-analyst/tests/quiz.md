## Scenario 1: Sacred Site Protection vs. Renewable Energy Development

**Event Description**:
A government approves a large-scale wind farm project on public lands that indigenous communities identify as sacred territory. The site contains burial grounds, ceremonial areas, and is part of traditional migration routes used for seasonal gathering practices spanning millennia. The wind farm promises 500 megawatts of clean energy, thousands of construction jobs, and significant tax revenue for economically depressed counties. Environmental impact assessments found no endangered species concerns and minimal habitat disruption. The indigenous nation was "consulted" through three public meetings but their concerns about spiritual significance, ceremonial disruption, and treaty violations were not incorporated into final plans. The nation argues this land was never legally ceded and remains sovereign territory under treaty law. The project also threatens viewsheds essential to ceremonial practices and would require roads fragmenting traditional gathering areas.

**Analysis Task**:
Analyze this conflict through indigenous knowledge frameworks and sovereignty principles.

### Expected Analysis Elements

- [ ] **Worldview Clash Analysis**:
  - Western: Land as resource, commodity, property to be developed
  - Indigenous: Land as sacred, ancestor, relative, living entity with rights
  - Western: Environmental impact = species count, habitat metrics
  - Indigenous: Impact = relationship disruption, spiritual harm, intergenerational obligation breach
  - Western: Linear time (immediate jobs/revenue)
  - Indigenous: Cyclical/intergenerational time (millennia of practice)

- [ ] **Sovereignty & Legal Framework**:
  - Treaty rights: Legal standing, historical context, ongoing violations
  - Free, Prior, Informed Consent (FPIC - UN Declaration on Rights of Indigenous Peoples)
  - Consultation vs. consent: "Consultation" as performative box-checking
  - Domestic dependent nations status: Legal limbo, sovereignty limitations
  - Sacred Sites Protection Act (inadequate enforcement)
  - Environmental racism: Marginalized lands targeted for industrial projects

- [ ] **Relational Ontology**:
  - Land as kin, not property: Reciprocal obligations to care for relatives
  - Intergenerational responsibility: Seven generations principle
  - Ceremonial practice as essential (not recreational/cultural luxury)
  - Place-based knowledge: Cannot be relocated or substituted
  - Spiritual ecology: Non-material relationships with place
  - Burial grounds: Ancestors present, not merely historical artifacts

- [ ] **False Binary Critique**:
  - Development vs. environment (both Western framings)
  - Jobs vs. culture (assumes economics trump spirituality)
  - Clean energy vs. indigenous rights (pits climate action against justice)
  - Alternatives ignored: Indigenous-led renewable development, different site selection, community benefit agreements with real sovereignty

- [ ] **Historical Context**:
  - Pattern of dispossession: Land theft, forced removal, genocide
  - Resource extraction history: Mining, logging, dams on indigenous lands
  - Boarding schools, language loss, cultural genocide (ongoing trauma)
  - Environmental racism: Disproportionate toxic burden on indigenous communities
  - Contemporary: DAPL (Standing Rock), Line 3, lithium mining, etc.

- [ ] **Indigenous-Centered Solutions**:
  - True consent: Project redesign or cancellation based on indigenous decision
  - Co-management: Joint governance with veto power for indigenous nation
  - Reparative justice: Land return, treaty enforcement
  - Indigenous-led renewable energy: On terms respecting sacred geography
  - Traditional Ecological Knowledge (TEK) integration: Not extraction but partnership
  - Restorative practices: Healing harm already done

- [ ] **Decolonization Framework**:
  - Land back movement: Return of stolen lands
  - Cognitive justice: Indigenous epistemologies as equally valid
  - Structural change: Not inclusion in extractive systems but transformation of systems
  - Self-determination: Indigenous nations deciding own futures
  - Relationship repair: Settler responsibility, accountability

### Evaluation Criteria

## Scenario 2: Traditional Ecological Knowledge and Climate Adaptation

**Event Description**:
A coastal indigenous community faces accelerating climate impacts: Sea level rise threatening villages, warming waters depleting traditional fisheries, erosion destroying cultural sites, and changing seasonal patterns disrupting subsistence practices. Government agencies offer a managed retreat program (relocation to inland areas) and propose scientific climate adaptation research conducted by university teams. The indigenous community has millennia of Traditional Ecological Knowledge (TEK) about environmental change, seasonal patterns, and adaptive practices. Elders share oral histories of previous climate shifts and adaptation strategies used by ancestors. The community wants to remain on ancestral lands and implement TEK-based adaptation but lacks funding and faces skepticism from government scientists who view TEK as "anecdotal." Meanwhile, universities want to "study" and "document" indigenous knowledge without offering partnership, benefit sharing, or recognition of intellectual sovereignty.

**Analysis Task**:
Analyze this scenario through indigenous knowledge sovereignty and climate justice frameworks.

### Expected Analysis Elements

- [ ] **Traditional Ecological Knowledge (TEK) - Nature & Value**:
  - Multi-generational observational science (not anecdote)
  - Place-based, experiential, adaptive learning system
  - Holistic: Integrates ecological, spiritual, social dimensions
  - Oral transmission: Rich, precise, verified through practice
  - Complementary to Western science (not inferior/superior but different)
  - Predictive power: Long-term patterns, relationship changes

- [ ] **Knowledge Sovereignty & Intellectual Property**:
  - TEK as intellectual and cultural property of indigenous peoples
  - Biopiracy history: Corporations/researchers extracting knowledge without consent/compensation
  - Research ethics: OCAP principles (Ownership, Control, Access, Possession)
  - Extractive research vs. partnership research
  - Who benefits from knowledge? Who has authority to share?
  - Indigenous data sovereignty: Self-determination over information

- [ ] **Epistemological Justice**:
  - Western science as dominant/validated; TEK as "anecdotal/folkloric" (epistemic violence)
  - Double standards: Peer review for Western science, dismissal of intergenerational verification
  - Cognitive imperialism: One way of knowing imposed as universal
  - Two-Eyed Seeing (Etuaptmumk): Integrating TEK and Western science as equals
  - Indigenous scientists: Bridging worldviews, challenging hierarchies

- [ ] **Climate Justice & Indigenous Frontlines**:
  - Indigenous peoples: 5% of population, protect 80% of biodiversity
  - Least responsibility for climate change, greatest impacts
  - Frontline communities: Arctic, small islands, coastal, forest-dependent
  - Climate colonialism: Solutions that displace indigenous peoples (conservation, mitigation projects)
  - Just transition: Must center indigenous rights and self-determination

- [ ] **Managed Retreat Critique**:
  - Terminology: "Retreat" from whose perspective? (Defense of colonial state?)
  - Indigenous view: Ancestors, sacred sites, place-based identity cannot relocate
  - Forced displacement: Continuation of removal policies (Trail of Tears, Relocation Act)
  - Cultural genocide: Severing connection to land = destruction of identity
  - Alternatives: In-situ adaptation, land-based practices, flexible residence patterns

- [ ] **TEK-Based Adaptation Strategies**:
  - Seasonal mobility: Traditional practice (not "retreat" but cyclical relationship)
  - Diversified subsistence: Multiple food sources, reduces vulnerability
  - Observation systems: Phenological indicators, animal behavior, plant signals
  - Adaptive management: Responding to change based on continuous relationship with place
  - Intergenerational resilience: Stories of past changes provide templates
  - Spiritual practice: Ceremonies for healing land, maintaining relationships

- [ ] **Partnership Framework (Not Extraction)**:
  - Co-production of knowledge: Equal partnership, mutual respect
  - Benefit sharing: Financial, recognition, capacity building
  - Community-led research: Indigenous nations set priorities, control process
  - Funding equity: Resources for indigenous-led adaptation
  - Long-term relationship: Not one-off study but ongoing collaboration
  - Protocol respect: Following indigenous governance around knowledge sharing

### Evaluation Criteria

- **Domain Accuracy** (0-10): Correct understanding of TEK, knowledge sovereignty, two-eyed seeing
- **Analytical Depth** (0-10): Thoroughness of epistemological, justice, partnership analysis
- **Insight Specificity** (0-10): Clear identification of extractive dynamics and authentic partnership models

## Scenario 3: Language Revitalization and Cultural Continuity

**Event Description**:
An indigenous language spoken by only 47 fluent elders (all over age 70) faces imminent extinction. The language contains irreplaceable ecological knowledge, cultural concepts, and spiritual teachings that cannot be fully translated. The community has initiated a language revitalization program using immersion schools, elder-youth mentorship, and digital archiving. However, challenges are severe: Historical trauma from boarding schools (where children were punished for speaking indigenous languages) creates intergenerational pain around language use. Youth face pressure to prioritize English for economic opportunities. Linguists from universities offer to "preserve" the language through documentation but propose extractive methods (elders spend time with researchers rather than youth). Tech companies offer AI language learning apps but want to own the data and intellectual property. The community seeks a path that heals trauma, empowers youth, and keeps the language living (not just archived as artifact).

**Analysis Task**:
Analyze language revitalization through indigenous cultural sovereignty and decolonization frameworks.

### Expected Analysis Elements

- [ ] **Language as Worldview**:
  - Language = culture, epistemology, identity (not just communication tool)
  - Indigenous languages encode: Relationships to land, non-human kin, time, values
  - Concepts with no English equivalent: Entire categories of meaning
  - Grammar reflecting worldview: Animacy, verb-based vs. noun-based, relationality
  - Loss of language = loss of ways of knowing, being, relating
  - Example: Ecological terms describing plant relationships, seasonal indicators

- [ ] **Historical Trauma & Linguistic Genocide**:
  - Boarding schools: "Kill the Indian, save the man" (linguistic and cultural genocide)
  - Punishment for speaking indigenous languages (physical abuse, humiliation)
  - Intergenerational trauma: Parents don't teach language to protect children
  - Internalized shame: Association of language with punishment, poverty, backwardness
  - Language shift: English as survival strategy under colonialism
  - Ongoing impacts: Fear, grief, disconnection around language

- [ ] **Living Language vs. Archive**:
  - Living: Spoken in daily life, evolving, transmitting culture
  - Archived: Documentation (recordings, dictionaries) but no speakers
  - Risk: "Preservation" that prioritizes researchers over community use
  - False choice: Documentation can support revival if community-controlled
  - Reclamation: Language as resistance, healing, sovereignty act
  - Success measures: New speakers, language use domains, intergenerational transmission

- [ ] **Youth & Intergenerational Transmission**:
  - Youth need: Reason to speak language (peers, contexts, cultural pride)
  - Elder knowledge: Fluency, cultural context, traditional teachings
  - Generation gap: Boarding school era broke transmission chain
  - Immersion programs: Most effective (total language environment)
  - Master-apprentice programs: One-on-one intensive, relationship-based
  - Land-based learning: Language taught through traditional practices on territory

- [ ] **Extractive Research Critique**:
  - Linguists: Career advancement from indigenous languages, limited community benefit
  - Data extraction: Recordings, grammars published without community control
  - Time burden: Elders working with researchers instead of teaching youth
  - Ownership: Who controls recordings, materials, intellectual property?
  - Academic language: Documentation inaccessible to community members
  - Alternative: Community-based research, indigenous linguists, participatory methods

- [ ] **Technology & Intellectual Property**:
  - Tech offers: AI apps, databases, digital tools (seem helpful)
  - IP concerns: Who owns data? Can corporation profit from indigenous language?
  - Data sovereignty: Indigenous control over language data, cultural protocols
  - Cultural appropriation risk: Sacred knowledge made publicly accessible
  - Useful tools: When community-owned, support (not replace) human transmission
  - Example: FirstVoices (community-controlled language archive)

- [ ] **Decolonial Language Revitalization**:
  - Community-led: Indigenous governance over revitalization process
  - Healing-centered: Addresses trauma, creates safe spaces, rebuilds pride
  - Land-based: Language taught through relationship with territory
  - Intergenerational justice: Rebuilding transmission across generations
  - Resourced adequately: Funding for immersion schools, teacher training, elder honoraria
  - Political: Language rights, official status, education system integration
  - Cultural context: Language inseparable from ceremonies, stories, values

### Evaluation Criteria

- **Domain Accuracy** (0-10): Correct understanding of language-culture connection, historical trauma, revitalization methods
- **Analytical Depth** (0-10): Thoroughness of trauma analysis, extractive critique, decolonial frameworks
- **Insight Specificity** (0-10): Clear identification of living vs. archived language, community-led approaches
- **Historical/Contextual Grounding** (0-10): References to boarding schools, language revitalization movements, indigenous linguistics
- **Reasoning Clarity** (0-10): Logical flow from historical harm to healing-centered revitalization

**Minimum Passing Score**: 35/50

## Scenario 4: Resource Extraction and Free, Prior, Informed Consent (FPIC)

**Event Description**:
A multinational corporation seeks to develop a lithium mine on lands adjacent to indigenous territory. Lithium is critical for electric vehicle batteries and clean energy transition. The government fast-tracks environmental approvals citing climate urgency. The mining project would: Consume massive water resources in arid region (threatening indigenous water sources), create tailings ponds with toxic contamination risk, require transportation infrastructure through indigenous lands, and operate for 30+ years. The corporation offers an "impact benefit agreement" with jobs, scholarships, and revenue sharing. However, the indigenous nation was not consulted before government approval, the benefit agreement is offered as a done deal (sign or project proceeds anyway), and the corporation conducts "community engagement" by meeting with individuals rather than respecting indigenous governance structures. The nation's legal and cultural decision-making process requires consensus, ceremonies, and multi-generational consideration, but the corporation demands a decision within 90 days.

**Analysis Task**:
Analyze this scenario through FPIC principles, indigenous governance, and climate justice frameworks.

### Expected Analysis Elements

- [ ] **Free, Prior, Informed Consent (FPIC) - Principles**:
  - **Free**: No coercion, intimidation, manipulation, or conditional offers
  - **Prior**: Before project approval/implementation, not after
  - **Informed**: Full information, time to analyze, culturally appropriate formats
  - **Consent**: Right to say no, not just "consultation" (veto power)
  - Legal basis: UN Declaration on Rights of Indigenous Peoples (UNDRIP), ILO 169
  - Current case violations: Approval before consultation, timeline pressure, "sign or else" framing

- [ ] **Indigenous Governance & Decision-Making**:
  - Collective process: Not individual sign-offs, community consensus
  - Cultural protocols: Ceremonies, elder councils, deliberation norms
  - Intergenerational consideration: Seven generations impact assessment
  - Spiritual dimension: Relationship with land, non-human relatives consulted
  - Timeline mismatch: Corporate quarterly vs. indigenous intergenerational
  - Respect for process: Settler obligation to follow indigenous governance, not impose timelines

- [ ] **Water as Relative & Life**:
  - Indigenous water ontology: Water is alive, sacred, has rights
  - Water as first medicine: Spiritual and physical life
  - Watershed relationships: All beings dependent on water quality
  - Western approach: Water as resource to be extracted, commodified
  - Mining impacts: Depletion, contamination, intergenerational harm
  - Climate context: Arid regions, water scarcity intensifying
  - Water rights: Indigenous legal claims often senior to mining claims

- [ ] **False Climate Solution Critique**:
  - "Green sacrifice zones": Indigenous lands targeted for "clean" energy minerals
  - Climate colonialism: Solutions that harm frontline communities
  - Extraction continuity: Lithium mining replicates colonial resource extraction
  - Alternatives exist: Battery recycling, alternative chemistries, reduced consumption
  - Just transition: Must not repeat extraction patterns under green label
  - Indigenous climate leadership: Most effective land stewards (should lead, not sacrifice)

- [ ] **Impact Benefit Agreement (IBA) Critique**:
  - Offered post-approval: Not FPIC, but mitigation after violation
  - Economic coercion: Jobs/money to overcome opposition
  - Individual vs. collective: Divides community, undermines governance
  - Inadequate: Money can't compensate for water contamination, sacred site destruction
  - Liability limits: Corporations insulate from long-term harm
  - Alternative: Indigenous nations as economic partners with equity, veto power, co-management

- [ ] **Intergenerational Justice**:
  - 30-year mine, multi-century impacts (tailings, water, reclamation failure)
  - Seven generations principle: Consider 7 generations forward
  - Irreversible harm: Water contamination, ecosystem disruption
  - Ancestors and descendants: Both present in decision-making
  - Precautionary principle: When harm uncertain, protect
  - Reciprocal obligation: Current generation as caretakers, not owners

- [ ] **Indigenous-Centered Alternatives**:
  - No means no: Respect consent refusal
  - Redesign: Different location, indigenous-led site selection
  - Indigenous equity: Nation as co-owner, not "beneficiary"
  - Co-governance: Joint management with indigenous veto power
  - Circular economy: Prioritize recycling, reduce extraction demand
  - Land back: Return lands to indigenous management for protection
  - Legal enforcement: Strengthen FPIC with domestic enforcement mechanisms

### Evaluation Criteria

- **Domain Accuracy** (0-10): Correct understanding of FPIC, indigenous governance, relational ontology
- **Analytical Depth** (0-10): Thoroughness of consent analysis, power dynamics, alternatives
- **Insight Specificity** (0-10): Clear identification of violations, false solutions, decolonial pathways
- **Historical/Contextual Grounding** (0-10): References to UNDRIP, extraction history, climate justice
- **Reasoning Clarity** (0-10): Logical flow from FPIC principles to structural critique to solutions

**Minimum Passing Score**: 35/50

## Scenario 5: Urban Indigenous Identity and Visibility

**Event Description**:
A major city with a large but largely invisible urban indigenous population (60% of indigenous people in the country live in cities) undertakes an initiative to "recognize and celebrate" indigenous heritage. Proposals include: Renaming streets after indigenous leaders, installing public art by indigenous artists, land acknowledgment statements at government events, and indigenous cultural center. However, no consultation occurred with urban indigenous community organizations before announcing these plans. The initiatives are performative (symbolic gestures without structural change). Meanwhile, urban indigenous communities face: Homelessness crisis disproportionately affecting indigenous people, over-representation in incarceration, child welfare system apprehension of indigenous children, lack of culturally appropriate services, racism in housing/employment, and disconnection from land-based practices. Indigenous community leaders say: "We don't need land acknowledgments, we need land back. We don't need art, we need housing. We don't need symbolic gestures, we need sovereignty and resources."

**Analysis Task**:
Analyze this scenario through decolonization, urban indigenous experience, and structural change frameworks.

### Expected Analysis Elements

- [ ] **Urban Indigenous Experience - Complexity**:
  - Displacement: Many urban indigenous people result from forced relocation policies
  - Diaspora: Separated from home territories, traditional governance, language
  - Resilience: Urban indigenous communities create new forms of kinship, culture
  - Diversity: Multiple nations, intertribal connections, varied colonial impacts
  - Invisibility: Erasure narrative (indigenous people as historical/rural only)
  - Dual consciousness: Maintaining connection to home territories while navigating urban life

- [ ] **Symbolic Reconciliation Critique**:
  - Land acknowledgments: Empty ritual without land return or material change
  - Performative inclusion: Indigenous imagery/art while structure remains colonial
  - Diversity washing: Appearance of progress masking ongoing harm
  - Settler comfort: Gestures that make settlers feel good without accountability
  - Indigenous labor: Expected to provide cultural education, ceremonies for settler consumption
  - "Reconciliation" vs. decolonization: Reconciliation maintains status quo, decolonization transforms power

- [ ] **Structural vs. Symbolic Change**:
  - Symbolic: Acknowledgments, art, celebrations, apologies
  - Structural: Housing, sovereignty, resources, legal reform, land return
  - Current scenario: All symbolic, zero structural
  - What's needed: Transfer of resources, power, land
  - Adequate consultation: Would have revealed community priorities (housing, not statues)

- [ ] **Urban Indigenous Issues - Systemic**:
  - Housing: Homelessness crisis, discrimination, displacement, gentrification
  - Child welfare: Continued apprehension (Sixties Scoop ongoing), cultural genocide
  - Incarceration: Over-representation, criminalization of poverty/trauma
  - Healthcare: Lack of culturally safe services, racism, worse outcomes
  - Education: Dropout rates, curriculum erasure, hostile environments
  - Economic: Employment discrimination, poverty, lack of opportunities
  - Root cause: All connected to colonialism, ongoing dispossession

- [ ] **Decolonization - What It Requires**:
  - Land back: Return of stolen lands (not just acknowledgment they were stolen)
  - Resource redistribution: Reparations, funding for indigenous-led services
  - Sovereignty: Self-determination, indigenous governance authority
  - Legal reform: Jurisdiction, child welfare, policing, justice systems
  - Structural transformation: Not inclusion in oppressive systems but new systems
  - Settler accountability: Bearing costs of change, confronting complicity
  - Indigenous leadership: Not consultation but decision-making power

- [ ] **Urban Indigenous Leadership & Solutions**:
  - Indigenous-led housing (not shelters but culturally grounded homes)
  - Indigenous child welfare jurisdiction (keeping families together)
  - Urban reserves (land base within cities for indigenous sovereignty)
  - Indigenous cultural centers with wraparound services (not just museums)
  - Funding self-determination (core funding for indigenous organizations)
  - Land-based healing programs (access to traditional territories)
  - Indigenous urbanism: Cities designed with indigenous values, governance

- [ ] **Consultation vs. Consent**:
  - True consultation: Before decisions, with power to shape outcomes
  - Current case: Announced first, community reaction after
  - FPIC application: Applies to urban policy affecting indigenous people
  - Indigenous governance: Urban indigenous organizations as authorities
  - Co-design: Indigenous communities lead initiative design
  - Accountability: Ongoing relationship, not one-time event

### Evaluation Criteria

- **Domain Accuracy** (0-10): Correct understanding of urban indigenous experience, decolonization vs. reconciliation
- **Analytical Depth** (0-10): Thoroughness of structural analysis, symbolic vs. material critique
- **Insight Specificity** (0-10): Clear identification of performative gestures and structural alternatives
- **Historical/Contextual Grounding** (0-10): References to relocation policies, urban indigenous movements
