## Scenario 1: Space Debris Collision Risk Assessment

**Event Description**:
A defunct satellite (mass 5,000 kg) is orbiting Earth at 7.5 km/s at an altitude of 800 km. It's on a collision course with an active telecommunications satellite (mass 3,000 kg) orbiting at 7.6 km/s in the opposite direction. The predicted collision would occur in 48 hours. Space agencies are considering options: do nothing, attempt debris avoidance maneuver (requires 50 m/s delta-v), or pre-emptively destroy the defunct satellite with a missile. The collision zone is in a heavily used orbital corridor with 200+ active satellites.

**Analysis Task**:

- [ ] **Thermal Management**:
  - Air compression heating in front of pod (even in low pressure)
  - Heat generation from: drag, levitation systems, braking
  - Cooling in vacuum environment is challenging (no convection)
