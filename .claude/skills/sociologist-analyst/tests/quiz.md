# Sociologist Analyst - Domain Validation Quiz

## Purpose

This quiz validates that the sociologist analyst applies sociological frameworks correctly, identifies social structures and dynamics, and provides well-grounded analysis. Each scenario requires demonstration of sociological reasoning, theory application, and evidence-based social analysis.

## Scenario 1: Remote Work and Social Cohesion

**Event Description**:
A major tech company announces permanent remote-work policy post-pandemic. 80% of employees now work from home. After 18 months, HR data reveals: employee satisfaction scores increased 15%, productivity metrics up 10%, but voluntary turnover increased 25% (especially among employees with less than 2 years tenure). Exit interviews cite "lack of connection," "unclear culture," and "harder to build relationships." Mentorship program participation dropped 40%. Informal communication (watercooler conversations, lunch meetings) essentially eliminated. Company previously had strong culture emphasizing collaboration and innovation.

**Analysis Task**:
Analyze the social dynamics and organizational culture implications of remote work transition.

### Expected Analysis Elements

- [ ] **Social Capital Theory (Bourdieu, Coleman)**:
  - Bonding capital: Strong ties within groups (weakened by remote work)
  - Bridging capital: Weak ties across groups (severely reduced without informal contact)
  - Network density declining - fewer connections, more isolation
  - Social capital as resource for career advancement, information flow

- [ ] **Organizational Culture Analysis (Schein)**:
  - Culture transmission mechanisms disrupted (observation, stories, rituals)
  - Artifacts level: Physical office symbolism lost
  - Espoused values vs. enacted values divergence
  - Basic assumptions: Shifting from "collaboration" to "autonomy"
  - New employees lack cultural immersion

- [ ] **Weak Ties Theory (Granovetter)**:
  - Strength of weak ties: Information diffusion, opportunity awareness
  - Remote work eliminates serendipitous weak tie formation
  - Watercooler conversations = weak tie maintenance
  - Innovation requires bridging structural holes (Burt) - harder remotely
  - Career mobility depends on weak ties - exit survey evidence supports

- [ ] **Durkheim: Social Integration and Anomie**:
  - Mechanical solidarity: Direct, personal bonds (weakened)
  - Organic solidarity: Interdependence through specialization (may strengthen)
  - Anomie risk: Normlessness, unclear expectations remotely
  - Suicide studies analog: Social isolation correlates with distress
  - Collective conscience weakening

- [ ] **Goffman: Impression Management and Presentation of Self**:
  - Front stage vs. back stage collapse (home = work)
  - Dramaturgical performance harder via video
  - Reduced face-work and interaction rituals
  - Zoom fatigue: Constant performance without respite
  - Authenticity paradox: More personal setting, less personal connection

- [ ] **Group Dynamics and Gemeinschaft/Gesellschaft (Tonnies)**:
  - Gemeinschaft (community): Personal, emotional, holistic relationships - declining
  - Gesellschaft (society): Impersonal, transactional, specialized - increasing
  - Company culture shifting from community to marketplace
  - Implications for loyalty, commitment, retention

- [ ] **Empirical Patterns**:
  - Remote work literature: Productivity gains vs. innovation concerns
  - Social isolation effects on mental health
  - Generational differences: Entry-level vs. senior employees
  - Hybrid models as compromise
  - Industry variation (tech vs. manufacturing)

- [ ] **Structural Implications**:
  - Spatial restructuring: Urban to suburban/rural migration
  - Class dimensions: White-collar privilege vs. essential workers
  - Gender dynamics: Domestic labor distribution
  - Global labor market: Geographic arbitrage, talent competition
  - Inequality: Remote-capable vs. in-person-required jobs

### Evaluation Criteria

- **Domain Accuracy** (0-10): Correct application of social capital, culture, weak ties theories
- **Analytical Depth** (0-10): Thoroughness of social dynamics, structural implications
- **Insight Specificity** (0-10): Clear predictions about culture, retention, innovation

**Minimum Passing Score**: 35/50

## Scenario 2: Social Media and Political Polarization

**Event Description**:
Analysis of social media data over 10 years shows increasing political polarization: users primarily engage with ideologically similar content (70% of shared articles align with user's political orientation), cross-partisan interactions declined 40%, and extreme content receives 3x more engagement (likes, shares) than moderate content. Algorithmic recommendation systems optimize for engagement, which correlates with emotionally arousing and divisive content. Echo chambers form where users rarely encounter opposing views. Survey data shows declining trust in institutions, increasing perception of outgroup as threat, and greater tolerance for political violence.

**Analysis Task**:
Analyze the relationship between social media architecture and political polarization.

### Expected Analysis Elements

- [ ] **Homophily and Social Networks (McPherson, Lazarsfeld)**:

  - Identity threat increases defensiveness and polarization

- [ ] **Cultivation Theory and Media Effects (Gerbner)**:
  - Heavy media exposure shapes perception of social reality
  - Social media as "mean world syndrome" - amplifies conflict perception
  - Availability heuristic: Vivid, extreme content overrepresented
  - Agenda-setting: Social media elevates divisive issues
  - Spiral of silence: Perceived majority opinion suppresses dissent

- [ ] **Structural Analysis of Algorithms**:
  - Engagement optimization = emotional arousal optimization
  - Moral-emotional language increases virality (Brady et al.)
  - Recommendation systems create "rabbit holes"

  - Social media accelerates moral panic cycles
  - Amplification of outrage and offense-taking
  - "Cancel culture" as digital social control
  - Mob dynamics and pile-ons
  - Durkheim: Collective effervescence in digital form (outrage rituals)

- [ ] **Empirical Evidence**:
  - Boxell et al. (2020): Polarization predates social media in some countries
  - Bail et al. (2018): Exposure to opposing views may increase polarization
  - Guess et al. (2023): Deactivating Facebook reduces polarization
  - Mosleh et al. (2022): Social media incentivizes extreme expression
  - Cross-national variation: US vs. Europe polarization differences

- [ ] **Counter-Arguments and Complexity**:
  - Selection vs. causation: Do algorithms create polarization or reflect it?
  - Backfire effect: Corrections sometimes entrench beliefs
  - Demand-side factors: Users seek polarizing content
  - Alternative explanations: Economic inequality, party sorting, elite polarization
  - Context-dependence: Not all users equally affected

## Scenario 3: Gentrification and Urban Displacement

**Event Description**:
A historically low-income, predominantly Black neighborhood undergoes rapid transformation over 5 years. Median home prices increase 150%, rent increases 80%. Art galleries, coffee shops, and upscale restaurants replace longtime businesses. Demographics shift: neighborhood goes from 70% Black, 20% Latino, 10% White to 45% White, 30% Black, 25% Latino. 40% of original residents displaced. New residents are predominantly young, college-educated professionals. Community organizations report loss of social networks, cultural institutions closing, and longtime residents feeling like "strangers in their own neighborhood."

School A: AP course enrollment 60%, college attendance rate 95% (75% four-year), average SAT 1350. School B: AP enrollment 15%, college attendance 60% (30% four-year), average SAT 950. School A has 1:15 teacher ratio, extensive extracurriculars, college counselors. School B has 1:25 ratio, limited activities, one counselor for 600 students.

## Scenario 5: Gig Economy and Precarious Labor

**Event Description**:
Platform economy expands rapidly: ride-sharing, food delivery, task-based labor. Workers classified as independent contractors, not employees. Data shows: median hourly earnings $10-15 after expenses, no benefits (health insurance, retirement, paid leave), unpredictable schedules, algorithmic management. Workers report high stress, lack of control, constant surveillance via app ratings and tracking. 60% rely on gig work as primary income. Union organizing attempts face legal and structural barriers.
