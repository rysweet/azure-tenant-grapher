# Psychologist Analyst - Quick Reference

## TL;DR

Analyze through psychological lenses: cognition (perception, memory, decision-making, biases), behavior (motivation, reinforcement, habits), social influence (persuasion, conformity, group dynamics), development (lifespan changes), personality (individual differences), and mental health (wellbeing, clinical issues). Design for how humans actually think and behave, not idealized rational actors.

## When to Use

**Perfect For:**

- User experience and interface design
- Behavior change and habit formation
- Persuasive design and communication
- Team dynamics and collaboration
- Learning and education systems
- Mental health and wellbeing considerations
- Understanding cognitive biases in decision-making
- Motivation and engagement design

**Skip If:**

- No human users or behavior involved
- Purely technical or mechanical analysis
- Focused on social structures over individual psychology

## Core Frameworks

### Dual-Process Theory (Kahneman)

Two systems of thinking:

- **System 1**: Fast, automatic, intuitive, effortless, emotional (95% of decisions)
- **System 2**: Slow, deliberate, logical, effortful, rational (5% of decisions)

**Design implication**: Most behavior uses System 1. Design intuitive defaults, not systems requiring constant rational analysis.

### Cognitive Load Theory

Three types of mental load:

1. **Intrinsic**: Task difficulty itself
2. **Extraneous**: Unnecessary load from poor design (MINIMIZE THIS)
3. **Germane**: Beneficial load that aids learning

**Working memory limit**: 7±2 items. Break information into chunks.

### Self-Determination Theory (Deci & Ryan)

Three psychological needs for intrinsic motivation:

1. **Autonomy**: Control over choices and actions
2. **Competence**: Feeling capable and effective
3. **Relatedness**: Connection with others

Support these needs → intrinsic motivation. Undermine them → need for external rewards.

### Cialdini's Persuasion Principles

Six principles of influence:

1. **Reciprocity**: We return favors
2. **Commitment/Consistency**: We want to appear consistent
3. **Social Proof**: We follow what others do
4. **Liking**: We're influenced by people we like
5. **Authority**: We defer to experts
6. **Scarcity**: We want limited things

## Quick Analysis Steps

### Step 1: Identify Psychological Dimensions (3 min)

- What cognitive processes are involved? (perception, memory, decision-making)
- What motivates users? (intrinsic vs. extrinsic)
- What social factors influence behavior?
- What emotions are at play?
- What are individual differences? (age, ability, personality)

### Step 2: Analyze Cognitive Load (7 min)

- What information must users process?
- How much working memory is required? (keep under 7 items)
- What's intrinsic vs. extraneous load?
- Can extraneous load be reduced? (simplify, chunk, visualize)
- Is feedback immediate and clear?

### Step 3: Map Decision Points and Biases (8 min)

- Where do users make decisions?
- What cognitive biases might affect decisions?
  - Confirmation bias, availability heuristic, anchoring, sunk cost
- Are decisions System 1 (intuitive) or System 2 (analytical)?
- Can we design better defaults?
- How do we support good decisions and prevent errors?

### Step 4: Assess Motivation and Behavior (8 min)

- What behavior do we want to encourage/discourage?
- Is motivation intrinsic or extrinsic?
- Are psychological needs met? (autonomy, competence, relatedness)
- What reinforcement schedule is used? (variable ratio most effective)
- How can we support habit formation? (cues, routine, reward)

### Step 5: Evaluate Social and Emotional Factors (7 min)

- How do others influence behavior? (social proof, conformity)
- What emotions does experience evoke? (frustration, joy, anxiety)
- Is there social support or pressure?
- What persuasion principles apply?
- How do group dynamics affect outcomes?

### Step 6: Consider Individual Differences (7 min)

- What's the developmental stage? (children, adolescents, adults, elderly)
- What personality traits matter? (extraversion, conscientiousness, etc.)
- What range of cognitive abilities? (novices to experts)
- What accessibility needs? (neurodiversity, disabilities)
- How do we design for diversity while maintaining simplicity?

## Key Cognitive Biases

### In Decision Making

- **Confirmation bias**: Seeking info that confirms beliefs
- **Availability heuristic**: Judging by ease of recall (recent, vivid events overweighted)
- **Anchoring**: Over-relying on first information
- **Sunk cost fallacy**: Continuing due to past investment
- **Status quo bias**: Preference for current state
- **Overconfidence**: Overestimating our knowledge/abilities

### In Social Judgment

- **Fundamental attribution error**: Overestimate personality, underestimate situation
- **In-group bias**: Favor our group members
- **Halo effect**: One positive trait influences overall impression
- **Stereotyping**: Applying group generalizations to individuals

**Design to mitigate biases**: Make alternatives salient, require justification, provide base rates, implement cooling-off periods.

## Behavior Change (COM-B Model)

Three requirements for behavior:

1. **Capability**: Physical/psychological ability
2. **Opportunity**: Environmental/social enablement
3. **Motivation**: Reflective (plans, evaluations) and automatic (emotions, habits)

**Intervention**: Target what's missing. No amount of motivation helps if capability/opportunity lacking.

## Mental Models

Users have internal representations of how things work (often incorrect):

- **Match mental models**: Design to align with user expectations
- **Or educate**: If can't match, teach correct model explicitly
- **Test understanding**: Ask users to explain how it works

**Common mismatch**: Technical system model ≠ user mental model → confusion and errors

## Common Patterns

### Pattern: Default Effect

People stick with defaults (status quo bias + decision avoidance):

- **Power of defaults**: Organ donation, retirement savings, privacy settings
- **Design implication**: Make the right choice the default choice

### Pattern: Variable Ratio Reinforcement

Unpredictable rewards create strongest habits:

- **Examples**: Slot machines, social media notifications, loot boxes
- **Ethical consideration**: Highly effective but potentially exploitative

### Pattern: Cognitive Dissonance

Discomfort from inconsistent beliefs/behaviors leads to rationalization:

- **Post-purchase rationalization**: Justify past decisions
- **Commitment escalation**: Small commitments lead to larger ones

### Pattern: Social Proof

People follow others, especially when uncertain:

- **Design use**: Reviews, testimonials, "X people bought this", social norms
- **Warning**: Can backfire if showing undesirable behavior is common

## Red Flags

**Psychological Warning Signs:**

- Ignoring cognitive load (overwhelming users)
- Manipulative persuasion (dark patterns)
- Addictive design features (variable rewards, infinite scroll, FOMO)
- Assuming users are rational actors (ignoring biases and emotions)
- One-size-fits-all (ignoring individual differences)
- Inaccessible to neurodivergent users
- Undermining autonomy, competence, or relatedness
- Designing for ideal users, not real humans

**Ethical Red Flags:**

- Exploiting cognitive biases for profit
- Creating anxiety or FOMO deliberately
- Addictive features targeting vulnerable populations
- Manipulating without informed consent
