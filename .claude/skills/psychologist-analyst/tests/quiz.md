## Scenario 1: Social Media Algorithm and Teen Mental Health Crisis

**Event Description**:
Mental health data shows a sharp increase in depression and anxiety among teenagers (ages 13-17) beginning around 2012, with rates doubling by 2020. The increase is most pronounced in girls, with self-harm hospitalizations up 62% for teen girls vs. 7% for boys. This timing coincides with widespread adoption of social media platforms (Instagram, Snapchat, TikTok). These platforms use engagement-maximizing algorithms that prioritize content generating strong emotional reactions. Features include: infinite scroll, "likes" and follower counts, photo filters creating idealized images, and personalized feeds showing curated highlight reels of peers' lives. Average screen time for teens is 7+ hours daily, with notifications occurring every few minutes.

**Analysis Task**:
Analyze the psychological mechanisms linking social media to mental health outcomes.

### Expected Analysis Elements

- [ ] **Social Comparison Theory**:
  - Upward social comparison: comparing self to idealized others
  - Reference group shift: comparing to curated global peers (vs. local community)
  - Highlight reel effect: seeing only positive moments creates unrealistic standards
  - Impact: reduced self-esteem, body dissatisfaction, feeling inadequate

- [ ] **Operant Conditioning and Dopamine Systems**:
  - Variable ratio reinforcement: unpredictable "likes" create strongest habit formation
  - Dopamine release: anticipation of social validation activates reward circuitry
  - Continuous partial reinforcement: most addictive schedule (slot machine effect)
  - Behavioral addiction: compulsive checking despite negative consequences

- [ ] **Cognitive Biases and Distortions**:
  - Negativity bias: negative feedback (criticism, unfollows) weighs more heavily
  - Catastrophizing: interpreting lack of engagement as social rejection
  - Mind reading: assuming others' thoughts/judgments based on online behavior
  - Filtering: focus on negative metrics, ignore positive interactions

- [ ] **Developmental Psychology**:
  - Adolescence: critical period for identity formation and peer relationships
  - Prefrontal cortex development: impulse control, risk assessment still maturing
  - Heightened social sensitivity: peers' opinions more influential during adolescence
  - Gender differences: girls more attuned to social relationships, vulnerable to relational aggression

- [ ] **Attention and Cognition**:
  - Continuous partial attention: task switching every few minutes
  - Attentional control depletion: reduced ability to focus
  - Delayed gratification: preference for immediate small rewards over larger delayed rewards
  - Flow state disruption: interruptions prevent deep engagement

- [ ] **Sleep and Circadian Rhythms**:
  - Blue light exposure: suppresses melatonin, delays sleep onset
  - Sleep deprivation: 7+ hours screen time displaces sleep (teens need 8-10 hours)
  - Sleep loss effects: mood dysregulation, anxiety, depression, cognitive impairment
  - Bidirectional: depression/anxiety also disrupt sleep

- [ ] **Research Evidence and Alternative Explanations**:
  - Correlational data: association doesn't prove causation
  - Experimental studies: reduced social media use improves well-being (Hunt et al., 2018)
  - Alternative factors: academic pressure, economic uncertainty, parenting changes
  - Cross-cultural variation: mental health trends vary by country (social media is global)

### Evaluation Criteria

- **Domain Accuracy** (0-10): Correct application of social comparison, conditioning, developmental psychology
- **Analytical Depth** (0-10): Thoroughness of mechanisms, multiple pathways analysis
- **Insight Specificity** (0-10): Clear causal pathways, specific psychological processes
- **Historical Grounding** (0-10): References to research studies, empirical evidence
- **Reasoning Clarity** (0-10): Logical flow from mechanisms to outcomes

**Minimum Passing Score**: 35/50

## Scenario 2: Eyewitness Testimony in High-Profile Criminal Case

**Event Description**:
A person is on trial for armed robbery. The prosecution's key evidence is eyewitness testimony from three witnesses who identified the defendant in a police lineup. Details: the robbery occurred at 11 PM in a poorly lit convenience store; the perpetrator wore a mask covering the lower face; the incident lasted approximately 90 seconds; witnesses were extremely stressed (gun pointed at them); police conducted the lineup 2 weeks after the incident; the detective administering the lineup knew which person was the suspect; witnesses were shown photos of the suspect on news coverage before the lineup; all three witnesses expressed high confidence (8-10/10) in their identification during testimony.

**Analysis Task**:
Analyze the reliability of eyewitness testimony and identify psychological factors affecting accuracy.

### Expected Analysis Elements

- [ ] **Memory Encoding Factors**:
  - Stress and arousal: inverted-U relationship (moderate stress enhances, extreme stress impairs)
  - Weapon focus effect: attention drawn to gun, not perpetrator's face (Loftus et al.)
  - Duration: 90 seconds is brief for encoding facial features
  - Lighting: poor illumination impairs visual encoding
  - Partial occlusion: mask reduces available facial information

- [ ] **Memory Consolidation and Decay**:
  - Time delay: 2 weeks allows memory degradation and interference
  - Consolidation: stress hormones can enhance consolidation (but may prioritize weapon over face)
  - Forgetting curve: rapid initial decay, then plateaus
  - Schema-consistent distortion: memory reconstructed to fit expectations

- [ ] **Memory Retrieval and Contamination**:
  - Post-event information: news coverage exposure creates false memories
  - Misinformation effect (Loftus): later information alters original memory
  - Source confusion: can't distinguish actual memory from news photos
  - Repeated retrieval: each recall can modify memory (reconsolidation)

- [ ] **Lineup Procedures and Bias**:
  - Administrator bias: detective knowing suspect can inadvertently cue witnesses
  - Double-blind procedure needed: neither witness nor administrator knows suspect
  - Sequential vs. simultaneous: sequential lineups reduce false identifications
  - Foil selection: similarity of non-suspects to description matters
  - Instructions: "suspect may not be present" reduces guessing

- [ ] **Confidence-Accuracy Relationship**:
  - Weak correlation: confidence doesn't predict accuracy reliably
  - Confidence malleability: feedback increases confidence without improving accuracy
  - Post-identification feedback: "Good, you identified the suspect" inflates confidence
  - Court influence: jurors heavily weight witness confidence (but shouldn't)

- [ ] **Cross-Race Effect**:
  - Own-race bias: better recognition for own race vs. other races
  - Perceptual expertise: more experience with within-race facial features
  - If applicable: assess whether witnesses and suspect are same race

- [ ] **Research Evidence and Recommendations**:
  - DNA exonerations: eyewitness misidentification in ~70% of wrongful convictions
  - Innocence Project data: systemic problems with eyewitness evidence
  - Best practices: double-blind lineups, sequential presentation, unbiased instructions
  - Expert testimony: educate juries on memory limitations

### Evaluation Criteria

- **Domain Accuracy** (0-10): Correct memory encoding, consolidation, retrieval principles
- **Analytical Depth** (0-10): Thoroughness of contamination factors, lineup bias analysis
- **Insight Specificity** (0-10): Clear identification of specific problems, recommendations
- **Historical Grounding** (0-10): References to Loftus research, DNA exoneration data
- **Reasoning Clarity** (0-10): Logical assessment of reliability issues

**Minimum Passing Score**: 35/50

## Scenario 3: Burnout Epidemic Among Healthcare Workers Post-Pandemic

**Event Description**:
Surveys reveal that 60% of healthcare workers report symptoms of burnout 3 years post-pandemic, up from 35% pre-pandemic. Symptoms include: emotional exhaustion (feeling drained, unable to recover between shifts), depersonalization (cynical detachment from patients), and reduced sense of accomplishment. Contributing factors: prolonged high-stress environment, moral injury (inability to provide adequate care due to resource constraints), staff shortages requiring mandatory overtime, traumatic patient deaths, threats from frustrated patients/families, and lack of organizational support. Mental health consequences include depression (24%), anxiety (30%), PTSD (15%), and substance use (12%). Turnover rates have increased 50%, with many leaving the profession entirely.

**Analysis Task**:
Analyze the psychological mechanisms of burnout and develop intervention strategies.

### Expected Analysis Elements

- [ ] **Burnout Model (Maslach)**:
  - Three dimensions: emotional exhaustion, depersonalization, reduced accomplishment
  - Chronic workplace stress: not about individual weakness, but situational factors
  - Mismatch between person and job demands
  - Progressive: early warning signs → full burnout → depression

- [ ] **Stress and Allostatic Load**:
  - Acute stress: adaptive HPA axis activation (cortisol, adrenaline)
  - Chronic stress: dysregulated stress response, elevated cortisol
  - Allostatic load: cumulative wear-and-tear on body/brain
  - Physiological consequences: cardiovascular, immune, neurological changes

- [ ] **Moral Injury**:
  - Definition: transgression of deeply held moral beliefs
  - Healthcare context: unable to provide standard of care (resource constraints)
  - Distinct from PTSD: violation of values, not just trauma exposure
  - Symptoms: guilt, shame, anger, loss of trust, existential questioning

- [ ] **Cognitive and Emotional Effects**:
  - Emotional exhaustion: depleted emotional resources, compassion fatigue
  - Depersonalization: defensive coping, distancing from patients as protection
  - Cognitive impairment: reduced attention, decision-making, memory
  - Learned helplessness: repeated uncontrollability reduces motivation

- [ ] **Social and Organizational Factors**:
  - Job demands-resources model: high demands + low resources = burnout
  - Demands: workload, time pressure, emotional labor, trauma exposure
  - Resources: autonomy, social support, recognition, manageable caseload
  - Organizational culture: stigma around mental health help-seeking

- [ ] **Interventions and Prevention**:
  - **Individual-level**: cognitive-behavioral therapy, mindfulness, self-care (but insufficient alone)
  - **Organizational-level**: reduce workload, increase staffing, provide support, address moral injury
  - **Systemic-level**: healthcare policy, adequate funding, workforce planning
  - Most effective: multi-level interventions (not just individual resilience training)

- [ ] **Research Evidence**:
  - Burnout rates pre-pandemic: 35-54% (already high)
  - Pandemic impact: prolonged stress, trauma, resource scarcity
  - Consequences: medical errors, patient safety, turnover, personal mental health
  - Effective interventions: organizational changes more effective than individual programs

### Evaluation Criteria

- **Domain Accuracy** (0-10): Correct burnout model, stress physiology, moral injury concepts
- **Analytical Depth** (0-10): Thoroughness of mechanisms, multi-level factor analysis
- **Insight Specificity** (0-10): Clear intervention recommendations, level-appropriate solutions
- **Historical Grounding** (0-10): References to Maslach, pandemic data, research evidence
- **Reasoning Clarity** (0-10): Logical flow from causes to consequences to interventions

**Minimum Passing Score**: 35/50

## Scenario 4: Conspiracy Theory Belief and Radicalization Online

**Event Description**:
A person has become increasingly isolated from family and friends after falling into conspiracy theory communities online. Over 18 months, their beliefs progressed from distrust of mainstream media, to acceptance of increasingly extreme theories (election fraud, harmful vaccines, global elite control), to endorsement of violence against perceived enemies. Their social media feeds are curated by algorithms showing primarily conspiratorial content, creating an echo chamber. They spend 6+ hours daily in online forums with like-minded individuals who reinforce beliefs. Attempts by family to provide contradictory evidence have been rejected as "propaganda," actually strengthening convictions. The person reports feeling they have "awakened" to hidden truths while others are "asleep."

**Analysis Task**:
Analyze the psychological mechanisms of conspiracy belief and radicalization pathways.

### Expected Analysis Elements

- [ ] **Cognitive Mechanisms**:
  - Pattern recognition: evolved tendency to detect patterns (even when not present)
  - Proportionality bias: major events must have major causes (not random)
  - Illusory correlation: seeing connections between unrelated events
  - Confirmation bias: seeking/interpreting evidence supporting existing beliefs

- [ ] **Motivated Reasoning**:
  - Epistemic motives: need for understanding, causal explanations, certainty
  - Existential motives: need for control, reducing uncertainty/threat
  - Social motives: need for belonging, group identity, feeling special/unique
  - Conspiracy theories fulfill these needs (even if factually wrong)

- [ ] **Social Identity and Group Dynamics**:
  - In-group/out-group: "awakened" vs. "sheep"
  - Identity fusion: personal identity merged with group identity
  - Social proof: if many people believe, must be true
  - Groupthink: conformity pressure, suppression of dissent

- [ ] **Backfire Effect and Belief Perseverance**:
  - Backfire effect: contradictory evidence strengthens belief (not always replicated)
  - Belief perseverance: maintaining belief despite disconfirmation
  - Cognitive dissonance: discomfort from conflicting information
  - Rationalization: generating explanations to preserve core beliefs

- [ ] **Algorithmic Amplification**:
  - Recommendation algorithms: optimize for engagement (outrage, fear)
  - Filter bubble: self-reinforcing information environment
  - Radicalization pipeline: gradual progression to extreme content
  - Echo chamber: social reinforcement, lack of diverse perspectives

- [ ] **Radicalization Process**:
  - Pre-radicalization: grievances, alienation, seeking meaning
  - Self-identification: discovery of ideology, community
  - Indoctrination: deepening beliefs, increasing commitment
  - Action: willingness to act on beliefs (activism → violence)
  - Stochastic terrorism: probability someone will act increases with exposed population

- [ ] **Intervention Strategies**:
  - **Ineffective**: direct confrontation, fact-checking (often backfires)
  - **More effective**: motivational interviewing, epistemic humility, addressing underlying needs
  - Deradicalization programs: exit support, alternative communities
  - Prevention: media literacy, critical thinking, algorithmic transparency

### Evaluation Criteria

- **Domain Accuracy** (0-10): Correct cognitive biases, motivated reasoning, radicalization models
- **Analytical Depth** (0-10): Thoroughness of psychological mechanisms, social dynamics
- **Insight Specificity** (0-10): Clear pathway explanation, specific intervention strategies
- **Historical Grounding** (0-10): References to radicalization research, deradicalization programs
- **Reasoning Clarity** (0-10): Logical flow from individual psychology to social dynamics

**Minimum Passing Score**: 35/50

## Scenario 5: Addiction Relapse After Successful Treatment

**Event Description**:
A person completed a 90-day residential treatment program for opioid addiction 6 months ago, achieving abstinence and engaging actively in recovery. They attended support groups, developed coping skills, reconnected with family, and started employment. Last week, they relapsed after encountering a friend from their past drug use at a concert. The environment (music venue where they previously used), the friend (strong association with drug use), and stress from a recent job conflict combined. They report that seeing the friend triggered intense cravings they hadn't experienced in months. After using once, they continued using for 3 days before seeking help. They feel ashamed and defeated, questioning whether they can ever achieve lasting recovery.

**Analysis Task**:
Analyze the neurobiology and psychology of addiction relapse and develop relapse prevention strategies.

### Expected Analysis Elements

- [ ] **Neurobiology of Addiction**:
  - Reward pathway: dopamine in nucleus accumbens, ventral tegmental area
  - Drug hijacking: supranormal dopamine surge (2-10× natural rewards)
  - Neuroplasticity: repeated drug use strengthens drug-seeking circuits
  - Prefrontal cortex: impaired inhibitory control, decision-making

- [ ] **Classical Conditioning and Cue-Induced Craving**:
  - Conditioned stimuli: people, places, emotions associated with drug use
  - Conditioned response: cravings, physiological arousal
  - Friend + venue = powerful conditioned cues (multiple associations)
  - Extinction: cue exposure without drug use weakens associations (but slow, incomplete)

- [ ] **Incentive Sensitization Theory**:
  - Drug cues trigger "wanting" (craving) not "liking" (pleasure)
  - Hypersensitivity to drug cues persists long after abstinence
  - Stress intensifies cue reactivity
  - Unconscious/automatic processes drive cravings

- [ ] **Stress and Self-Regulation**:
  - Job conflict: stress depletes self-regulatory resources
  - Stress increases drug cravings (corticotropin-releasing factor)
  - Ego depletion: limited willpower, sequential self-control tasks impair subsequent control
  - Negative reinforcement: drug use to escape negative emotions

- [ ] **Abstinence Violation Effect (AVE)**:
  - Initial lapse → self-blame, guilt, feeling like failure
  - Black-and-white thinking: "I've already ruined it, might as well continue"
  - Self-fulfilling prophecy: belief in inability to recover undermines recovery efforts
  - Contrast: lapse as learning opportunity vs. total failure

- [ ] **Recovery as Chronic Disease Management**:
  - Relapse rates: 40-60% for substance use (similar to diabetes, hypertension)
  - Not moral failure: brain-based disorder with biological vulnerabilities
  - Recovery trajectory: typically involves multiple attempts, not linear
  - Need for ongoing management: like chronic disease, not acute cure

- [ ] **Relapse Prevention Strategies**:
  - **Cognitive-behavioral**: identify triggers, develop coping skills, challenge AVE thoughts
  - **Mindfulness**: accept cravings without acting, urge surfing
  - **Medication-assisted treatment**: naltrexone (blocks opioid receptors), buprenorphine
  - **Social support**: 12-step programs, peer support, accountability
  - **Environmental modification**: avoid high-risk situations, build recovery-supportive network

### Evaluation Criteria

- **Domain Accuracy** (0-10): Correct neurobiology, conditioning, stress mechanisms
- **Analytical Depth** (0-10): Thoroughness of relapse factors, prevention strategies
- **Insight Specificity** (0-10): Clear explanation of mechanisms, specific interventions
- **Historical Grounding** (0-10): References to addiction research, treatment outcomes
- **Reasoning Clarity** (0-10): Logical flow from neurobiology to behavior to intervention

**Minimum Passing Score**: 35/50
