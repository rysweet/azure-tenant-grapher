## Scenario 1: Employment Discrimination Claim

**Event Description**:
A 55-year-old software engineer at a tech company is laid off during workforce reduction. She is replaced by a 28-year-old engineer at lower salary. The company cites "skills mismatch" and "cultural fit" as reasons. The engineer has performance reviews showing "meets expectations" consistently. She files an EEOC complaint alleging age discrimination under ADEA. Discovery reveals: (1) 80% of layoffs affected employees over 50, (2) company Slack messages joke about "old guard" needing to move on, (3) CEO publicly stated desire to "bring young energy" to engineering.

**Analysis Task**:
Analyze the legal claims and litigation risk.

### Expected Analysis Elements

- [ ] **Legal Framework**:
  - Age Discrimination in Employment Act (ADEA) - prohibits age discrimination for 40+
  - Prima facie case requirements (McDonnell Douglas framework)
  - Disparate treatment vs. disparate impact theories
  - Legitimate non-discriminatory reason defense
  - Pretext analysis

- [ ] **Prima Facie Case Analysis**:
  - Protected class: Age 55 (over 40) ✓
  - Qualified for position: "Meets expectations" reviews ✓
  - Adverse employment action: Termination ✓
  - Replaced by younger worker: Age 28 ✓
  - All four elements satisfied - prima facie case established

- [ ] **Employer's Burden: Legitimate Reason**:
  - "Skills mismatch" - must be specific and documented
  - "Cultural fit" - subjective, potential pretext concern
  - Workforce reduction - legitimate business reason if applied uniformly
  - Burden of production (not persuasion) at this stage

- [ ] **Pretext Analysis**:
  - **Strong evidence of pretext**:
    - Statistical disparity (80% over 50 - significant)
    - Slack messages ("old guard") - direct evidence of animus
    - CEO statements ("young energy") - age-based decision-making
    - Salary reduction motive (younger = cheaper)
  - Cat's paw theory: Biased subordinates influenced decision

- [ ] **Discovery and Evidence**:
  - Smoking gun: Slack messages and CEO statements
  - Statistical analysis: Layoff demographics
  - Comparative evidence: Similarly situated younger employees retained
  - Email/communication patterns
  - Decision-maker depositions crucial

- [ ] **Damages Exposure**:
  - Back pay: Lost wages from termination to judgment
  - Front pay: Future lost earnings if reinstatement not feasible
  - Liquidated damages: Doubling of back pay for willful violations
  - Attorney's fees: Plaintiff's fees if successful
  - No compensatory/punitive damages under ADEA (unlike Title VII)

- [ ] **Litigation Risk Assessment**:
  - **Plaintiff strengths**: Direct evidence, statistics, replacement
  - **Defendant weaknesses**: Poor documentation, biased communications
  - **Settlement value**: High (strong case, public relations risk)
  - **Jury appeal**: Sympathetic plaintiff, age discrimination resonates
  - Recommendation: Early settlement likely optimal

- [ ] **Relevant Precedents**:
  - Gross v. FBL Financial Services (2009): Retaliation standard, "but-for" causation
  - Hazen Paper Co. v. Biggins (1993): Age vs. pension vesting
  - O'Connor v. Consolidated Coin Caterers (1996): Replacement by younger sufficient
  - Reeves v. Sanderson Plumbing (2000): Pretext can establish intentional discrimination

### Evaluation Criteria

- **Domain Accuracy** (0-10): Correct application of ADEA, McDonnell Douglas, pretext analysis
- **Analytical Depth** (0-10): Thoroughness of prima facie case, evidence evaluation, damages
- **Insight Specificity** (0-10): Clear litigation risk assessment, specific recommendations
- **Historical Grounding** (0-10): References to relevant case law and precedents
- **Reasoning Clarity** (0-10): Logical flow from facts to law to conclusion

**Minimum Passing Score**: 35/50

## Scenario 2: Contract Dispute Over Software License

**Event Description**:
TechCorp licenses enterprise software to ClientCo under 3-year agreement ($500K/year). Contract includes: (1) license for "internal business purposes," (2) prohibition on "reselling or sublicensing," (3) support and updates included. ClientCo integrates the software into SaaS product sold to customers. TechCorp discovers this and demands: (1) $5M in past unauthorized use damages, (2) $2M/year going forward for commercial license. ClientCo argues their use is "internal" since software runs on their servers for their business operations. Contract is ambiguous on this scenario.

**Analysis Task**:
Analyze the contract dispute and likely outcomes.

### Expected Analysis Elements

- [ ] **Contract Interpretation Framework**:
  - Plain meaning rule: Text's ordinary meaning controls
  - Ambiguity analysis: Is "internal business purposes" clear?
  - Parol evidence rule: Extrinsic evidence if ambiguous
  - Contra proferentem: Ambiguity against drafter (TechCorp)
  - Course of performance and industry custom

- [ ] **Key Terms Analysis**:
  - "Internal business purposes": Ambiguous
    - TechCorp view: Internal consumption only, not revenue-generating use
    - ClientCo view: Internal systems supporting business operations
  - "Reselling or sublicensing": Not directly applicable
    - ClientCo not reselling the software itself
    - But is commercial use a form of exploitation beyond "internal"?
  - No "SaaS" or "commercial use" terms in contract (pre-cloud era agreement?)

- [ ] **Ambiguity Resolution**:
  - Parol evidence: Negotiations, prior drafts, communications
  - Course of performance: Was ClientCo's use known and accepted?
  - Industry custom: What do similar licenses typically permit?
  - Contra proferentem: TechCorp drafted, ambiguity against them
  - Reasonable expectations of parties

- [ ] **Breach Analysis**:
  - **If TechCorp prevails**: Material breach, unauthorized commercial use
  - **If ClientCo prevails**: Use within "internal business purposes"
  - Middle ground: Use technically violates spirit but not letter
  - Reformation possibility: Court may reform contract to reflect intent

- [ ] **Damages Analysis**:
  - **Contract damages**: Expectancy damages (benefit of bargain)
  - TechCorp's $5M claim: Unjust enrichment or lost license fees
  - Calculation method: Difference between standard and commercial license
  - Mitigation: ClientCo could have negotiated commercial license
  - Punitive damages: Generally not available in contract cases

- [ ] **Defenses and Counterclaims**:
  - **ClientCo defenses**:
    - Ambiguity + contra proferentem
    - Good faith and fair dealing
    - Estoppel (if TechCorp knew and didn't object)
    - Laches (unreasonable delay in asserting rights)
  - **Counterclaims**: None obvious unless bad faith in TechCorp's conduct

- [ ] **Remedies and Strategic Considerations**:
  - **Injunction**: TechCorp may seek to stop ClientCo's use
  - **Negotiated resolution**: Commercial license going forward
  - **Risk analysis**:
    - TechCorp risk: Contra proferentem, damage calculation disputes
    - ClientCo risk: Permanent injunction shutting down SaaS product
  - **Settlement zone**: Retroactive commercial license at discount

- [ ] **Relevant Precedents**:
  - ProCD v. Zeidenberg (1996): Shrinkwrap licenses, use restrictions
  - Specht v. Netscape (2002): Clickwrap/browsewrap enforceability
  - Jacobsen v. Katzer (2008): Open source license breach = copyright infringement
  - Vernor v. Autodesk (2010): License vs. sale, first sale doctrine
  - Sun Microsystems v. Microsoft (2001): Java license restrictions

### Evaluation Criteria

- **Domain Accuracy** (0-10): Correct application of contract interpretation, ambiguity rules
- **Analytical Depth** (0-10): Thoroughness of term analysis, damages, remedies
- **Insight Specificity** (0-10): Clear risk assessment, specific settlement recommendations
- **Historical Grounding** (0-10): References to relevant contract and IP case law
- **Reasoning Clarity** (0-10): Logical flow from interpretation to outcomes

**Minimum Passing Score**: 35/50

## Scenario 3: Data Privacy Regulatory Compliance

**Event Description**:
A US-based e-commerce company with EU customers suffers data breach exposing 100,000 customer records (names, emails, addresses, purchase history, encrypted credit cards). Company discovers breach 2 weeks after occurrence. Company has: (1) no designated EU representative, (2) no Data Protection Officer (DPO), (3) privacy policy states "compliant with applicable laws" but no GDPR-specific provisions. Company processes payments through US payment processor. Irish Data Protection Commission (DPC) initiates investigation. Affected individuals include 80,000 EU residents and 20,000 US residents.

**Analysis Task**:
Analyze regulatory compliance issues and legal exposure.

### Expected Analysis Elements

- [ ] **GDPR Applicability**:
  - Territorial scope (Art. 3): Offering goods/services to EU data subjects
  - Company clearly subject to GDPR (80,000 EU customers)
  - Both EU and non-EU entities subject if processing EU data
  - No physical presence required for GDPR application

- [ ] **GDPR Violations Identified**:
  - **Art. 27: No EU representative** (required for non-EU controllers)
  - **Art. 37: No DPO** (may be required depending on processing scale/type)
  - **Art. 33: Breach notification delay** (72-hour requirement likely missed)
  - **Art. 34: Data subject notification** (must notify affected individuals)
  - **Art. 5: Security measures** (breach suggests inadequate security)
  - **Art. 32: Technical and organizational measures** (insufficient safeguards)

- [ ] **Breach Notification Requirements**:
  - **GDPR (Art. 33)**: 72 hours to supervisory authority (DPC in this case)
  - **GDPR (Art. 34)**: Notification to data subjects without undue delay
  - **US state laws**: California (CCPA), New York (SHIELD Act), others - various timelines
  - Company discovered breach at 2 weeks - notification timing critical
  - Late notification is separate violation with penalties

- [ ] **US Law Obligations**:
  - **State breach notification laws**: All 50 states have laws
  - **CCPA**: California residents (subset of 20,000 US) have rights
  - **FTC Act Section 5**: Unfair/deceptive practices (inadequate security)
  - **PCI DSS**: Payment card industry standards (encrypted cards = lower risk)
  - **State attorney general enforcement**: Multi-state coordination possible

- [ ] **Penalties and Fines**:
  - **GDPR fines**: Up to €20M or 4% global annual revenue (whichever higher)
  - Tiering: Administrative violations (Art. 27, 37) vs. principles violations (Art. 5, 32)
  - Mitigating factors: Cooperation, remediation, no prior violations
  - Aggravating factors: Delay in notification, lack of basic safeguards
  - **US fines**: State AG penalties, FTC consent orders, private litigation

- [ ] **Private Litigation Risk**:
  - **GDPR**: Data subjects can sue for damages (Art. 82)
  - **US**: Class action risk (20,000 US residents)
  - Standing issues: Actual harm vs. risk of harm (Spokeo, TransUnion precedents)
  - Damages: Statutory (GDPR), actual harm (US), attorney's fees
  - Settlement pressure: Class action economics favor settlement

- [ ] **Remediation and Compliance**:
  - Immediate: Appoint EU rep, DPO, notify authorities and individuals
  - Short-term: Security audit, incident response, forensics
  - Long-term: GDPR compliance program (privacy by design, DPIAs, records of processing)
  - Cooperation with DPC investigation
  - Remediation as mitigating factor in penalties

- [ ] **Relevant Precedents**:
  - British Airways (2020): €22M fine for breach, GDPR enforcement
  - Marriott (2020): €20M fine for breach affecting 339M guests
  - Facebook/Meta (2023): €1.2B fine for data transfers to US
  - Google CNIL (2019): €50M for lack of transparency and consent
  - Schrems II (2020): Invalidated Privacy Shield, EU-US data transfer framework

### Evaluation Criteria

- **Domain Accuracy** (0-10): Correct application of GDPR articles, US privacy laws
- **Analytical Depth** (0-10): Thoroughness of violation analysis, penalty assessment
- **Insight Specificity** (0-10): Clear compliance steps, specific regulatory risks

## Scenario 4: Patent Infringement Dispute

**Event Description**:
BigCorp holds patent on "method for one-click online purchasing" (filed 1997, granted 1999). Startup develops mobile app with "tap-to-buy" feature allowing single-tap purchases. BigCorp sends cease-and-desist alleging infringement and demands $10M license fee or faces lawsuit. Startup's IP counsel reviews patent and identifies: (1) prior art (academic paper from 1995 describes similar concept), (2) potential obviousness (combination of known elements), (3) abstract idea concerns (Alice Corp. v. CLS Bank implications). Startup has limited capital ($2M runway) and BigCorp has litigation war chest.

**Analysis Task**:
Analyze the patent dispute and strategic options.

### Expected Analysis Elements

- [ ] **Patent Infringement Analysis**:
  - Claim construction: Interpret patent claims (Markman hearing)
  - Literal infringement: Does "tap-to-buy" read on "one-click" claims?
  - Doctrine of equivalents: Substantially same function, way, result?
  - All-elements rule: Must meet every claim limitation
  - Prosecution history estoppel: Amendments during prosecution limit scope

- [ ] **Invalidity Defenses**:
  - **Prior art (35 USC 102)**: 1995 academic paper predates 1997 filing
    - Anticipation: Single reference discloses all elements
    - Public disclosure: Academic publication qualifies
    - Burden: Clear and convincing evidence to invalidate
  - **Obviousness (35 USC 103)**: Combination of known elements
    - Graham factors: Scope/content of prior art, differences, skill level, secondary considerations
    - KSR v. Teleflex: Combination of familiar elements may be obvious
  - **Patent-eligible subject matter (35 USC 101)**: Abstract idea?
    - Alice/Mayo framework: Abstract idea + no inventive concept = ineligible
    - "One-click purchasing" may be abstract business method

- [ ] **Alice Corp. v. CLS Bank (2014) Analysis**:
  - Step 1: Is claim directed to abstract idea? (Likely yes - method of conducting business)
  - Step 2: Does claim contain inventive concept? (Applying idea on computer insufficient)
  - Business method patents highly scrutinized post-Alice
  - Many e-commerce patents invalidated under Alice
  - Strong invalidity argument for Startup

- [ ] **Strategic Options**:
  - **Litigation**: High cost ($3-5M through trial), long duration (2-4 years)
  - **Inter Partes Review (IPR)**: USPTO administrative proceeding, cheaper ($300K), faster (18 months), lower burden
  - **Settlement/License**: Pay reduced fee, freedom to operate, avoid risk
  - **Design-around**: Modify feature to avoid infringement
  - **Declaratory judgment**: Startup sues first for non-infringement/invalidity

- [ ] **Economic and Business Considerations**:
  - Startup's $2M runway vs. $3-5M litigation cost = existential threat
  - BigCorp's war chest = litigation as anticompetitive weapon
  - Investor concerns: IP risk affects fundraising
  - Customer concerns: Will app be shut down?
  - Strategic alternatives: Insurance, defensive patent aggregation

- [ ] **Procedural Considerations**:
  - IPR vs. district court: IPR has higher invalidation rate (~60%)
  - Estoppel effects: IPR estoppel prevents raising same grounds in court
  - Forum shopping: Plaintiff chooses favorable district (Western District of Texas)
  - Stay pending IPR: District court may stay litigation pending USPTO review

- [ ] **Relevant Precedents**:
  - Alice Corp. v. CLS Bank (2014): Abstract idea + computer = ineligible
  - Amazon one-click patent: Narrowed after reexamination, controversies
  - KSR v. Teleflex (2007): Obviousness standard, combination of elements
  - eBay v. MercExchange (2006): Injunction factors (relevant if infringement found)
  - Octane Fitness v. ICON (2014): Attorney's fees for exceptional cases

### Evaluation Criteria

- **Domain Accuracy** (0-10): Correct application of patent law, infringement analysis, invalidity defenses
- **Analytical Depth** (0-10): Thoroughness of Alice analysis, strategic options, procedural paths
- **Insight Specificity** (0-10): Clear strategic recommendation, specific legal arguments
- **Historical Grounding** (0-10): References to Alice, KSR, and relevant patent precedents
- **Reasoning Clarity** (0-10): Logical flow from legal analysis to strategic recommendation

**Minimum Passing Score**: 35/50

## Scenario 5: Shareholder Derivative Suit

**Event Description**:
Public company's CEO sells $50M in stock 2 weeks before announcing disappointing earnings (40% revenue miss). Stock price drops 60% after announcement. CEO's sale was pursuant to 10b5-1 trading plan adopted 6 months earlier. Shareholders discover: (1) board compensation committee approved plan during blackout period, (2) CEO modified plan twice (shortening holding periods), (3) internal emails show CEO knew of upcoming revenue issues when adopting plan. Shareholders file derivative suit alleging breach of fiduciary duty and Section 10(b) securities fraud. Board forms special litigation committee (SLC) to investigate and recommends dismissal.

**Analysis Task**:
Analyze the derivative suit and likely outcomes.

### Expected Analysis Elements

- [ ] **Derivative Suit Procedural Requirements**:
  - Standing: Shareholder at time of wrongdoing and continuously
  - Demand requirement: Must demand board action or show futility
  - Demand futility: Board lacks independence/disinterest, or transaction not valid business judgment
  - Delaware law (assuming Delaware incorporation): Aronson/Rales test
  - Federal Rule 23.1: Particularized pleading requirements

- [ ] **Fiduciary Duty Analysis**:
  - **Duty of Loyalty**: Self-dealing, corporate opportunity, good faith
  - CEO stock sale = self-interest transaction
  - Breach: Trading on material non-public information
  - **Duty of Care**: Business judgment rule protection (generally)
  - Entire fairness review if loyalty implicated (fair process + fair price)

- [ ] **Section 10(b) and Rule 10b-5 Analysis**:
  - Elements: Material misrepresentation/omission, scienter, reliance, causation, damages
  - CEO's trade: Material MNPI (40% revenue miss is material)
  - Scienter: Internal emails showing knowledge
  - **10b5-1 defense**: Safe harbor for pre-planned trading
    - Requirements: Good faith, no MNPI, specific price/amount/date
    - Multiple modifications raise bad faith concerns
    - Adoption during blackout period suspicious

- [ ] **10b5-1 Plan Analysis**:
  - Plan adopted 6 months before trade (appears sufficient cooling-off)
  - BUT: Modified twice (undermines good faith)
  - Blackout period adoption (board approved - governance failure)
  - Emails showing CEO knew of problems when adopting = bad faith
  - Plan may not provide safe harbor defense
  - SEC 2022 amendments: Mandatory cooling-off periods, limits on modifications

- [ ] **Special Litigation Committee (SLC) Defense**:
  - Zapata Corp. v. Maldonado (1981): Delaware SLC framework
  - Two-step test: (1) SLC independence/good faith/reasonable investigation, (2) Court applies business judgment
  - SLC recommends dismissal - burden on SLC to show independence
  - Questions: Board independence (approved plan in blackout period), SLC composition
  - If SLC lacks independence, recommendation entitled to no deference

- [ ] **Damages and Remedies**:
  - Corporation as plaintiff (derivative suit)
  - Damages: Unjust enrichment to CEO (disgorgement of profits)
  - Calculation: Difference between sale price and price after announcement
  - SEC may also pursue action (parallel enforcement)
  - Injunctive relief: Governance reforms, clawback policies

- [ ] **Likely Outcomes**:
  - Motion to dismiss: Demand futility analysis crucial
  - Discovery: Emails, board minutes, SLC investigation materials
  - Settlement likely: Governance reforms + some payment
  - Trial risk: Bad facts (modifications, emails), CEO personally liable
  - SEC enforcement risk: Parallel investigation possible

- [ ] **Relevant Precedents**:
  - Zapata Corp. v. Maldonado (1981): SLC independence and business judgment
  - Aronson v. Lewis (1984): Demand futility test
  - SEC v. Dillon (2009): 10b5-1 bad faith, modifications undermine defense
  - Securities Exchange Act Rule 10b5-1: Trading plan safe harbor
  - Caremark International (1996): Oversight liability, good faith obligations

### Evaluation Criteria

- **Domain Accuracy** (0-10): Correct application of derivative suit procedure, fiduciary duties, securities law
- **Analytical Depth** (0-10): Thoroughness of 10b5-1 analysis, SLC review, demand futility
- **Insight Specificity** (0-10): Clear outcome predictions, specific legal defenses/attacks
- **Historical Grounding** (0-10): References to Zapata, Aronson, securities fraud precedents
- **Reasoning Clarity** (0-10): Logical flow from facts to law to procedural outcomes

**Minimum Passing Score**: 35/50
