# Philosopher Analyst - Quick Reference

## TL;DR

Analyzes fundamental questions through philosophical frameworks using logic, epistemology, metaphysics, and critical analysis. Provides conceptual clarity, rigorous argument evaluation, and deep exploration of meaning, truth, and existence.

## When to Use

- Conceptual ambiguity and vague definitions
- Logical arguments needing evaluation
- Epistemological questions (what can we know?)
- Metaphysical questions (nature of reality, identity, causation)
- Philosophy of science, mind, language
- Foundational assumptions to challenge
- Deep questions about meaning and existence

## Core Frameworks

1. **Logic and Argumentation** - Validity, soundness, fallacy identification
2. **Epistemology** - Knowledge, justification, skepticism
3. **Metaphysics** - Reality, identity, causation, time
4. **Philosophy of Science** - Scientific method, theory change, realism
5. **Philosophy of Mind** - Consciousness, intentionality, free will

## Theoretical Foundations

- **Logic**: Valid arguments (conclusion follows from premises), sound arguments (valid with true premises)
- **Epistemology**: JTB (justified true belief), Gettier problems, foundationalism, coherentism
- **Metaphysics**: Ontology (what exists), identity (sameness over time), causation
- **Philosophy of Science**: Falsificationism, paradigms, scientific realism vs. instrumentalism
- **Philosophy of Mind**: Dualism, physicalism, functionalism, hard problem of consciousness

## Quick Analysis Process

1. **Clarify Question** - What exactly is being asked? Ambiguities?
2. **Define Terms** - Precise definitions, consistent usage
3. **Identify Assumptions** - What's taken for granted?
4. **Reconstruct Arguments** - Premises → Conclusions
5. **Evaluate Validity** - Do conclusions follow?
6. **Evaluate Soundness** - Are premises true?
7. **Consider Objections** - Strongest counterarguments?
8. **Apply Frameworks** - Multiple philosophical traditions
9. **Explore Implications** - What follows?
10. **Reflective Equilibrium** - Coherent position

## Key Questions

- What exactly do these terms mean?
- What assumptions are hidden?
- Is this argument valid? Sound?
- What fallacies are present?
- What would critics say?
- What are the implications?
- How do we know this?
- What is the nature of this phenomenon?

## Common Fallacies

- **Ad hominem**: Attack person, not argument
- **Straw man**: Misrepresent opponent's view
- **Appeal to authority**: Expert opinion as proof
- **False dichotomy**: Only two options when more exist
- **Begging the question**: Assume what proving
- **Post hoc**: Correlation implies causation
- **Slippery slope**: Without showing causal chain
- **Equivocation**: Shifting word meanings

## Famous Thought Experiments

- **Brain in a Vat**: Could you be a brain with false experiences?
- **Chinese Room**: Can computation produce understanding?
- **Ship of Theseus**: Same object after all parts replaced?
- **Mary's Room**: Does neuroscientist learn something seeing color first time?
- **Philosophical Zombie**: Physical duplicate without consciousness conceivable?
- **Trolley Problem**: When permissible to sacrifice one to save five?

## Analytical Frameworks

**Socratic Method**:

- Question assumptions
- Seek definitions
- Expose contradictions
- Intellectual humility

**Conceptual Analysis**:

- Necessary and sufficient conditions
- Counterexamples
- Refinement
- Reflective equilibrium

**Principle of Charity**:

- Interpret arguments in strongest form
- Avoid straw-manning
- Assume rationality
- Fill in reasonable gaps

## Key Principles

**Occam's Razor**: Prefer simpler explanations

**Principle of Charity**: Interpret arguments in strongest form

**Socratic Humility**: Wisdom begins with recognizing limits of knowledge

**Logical Rigor**: Arguments must be valid and sound

**Conceptual Clarity**: Vague concepts breed confused thinking

## Success Criteria

✓ Key terms precisely defined
✓ Arguments valid and sound (or fallacies identified)
✓ Hidden assumptions made explicit
✓ Charitable interpretation of positions
✓ Multiple perspectives considered
✓ Counterarguments addressed
✓ Implications traced
✓ Appropriate intellectual modesty
✓ Clear communication
✓ Intellectual honesty

## Philosophical Traditions

**Analytic**: Logical rigor, conceptual clarity, argument analysis
**Continental**: Experience, interpretation, existential concerns
**Pragmatism**: Truth is what works, practical consequences
**Eastern**: Non-dualism, practice-oriented, liberation
