# Philosopher Analyst Skill

> **Analyze fundamental questions and arguments through rigorous philosophical frameworks to achieve conceptual clarity and logical precision.**

## Overview

The Philosopher Analyst skill enables Claude to perform deep conceptual analysis and argument evaluation. Drawing on logic, epistemology, metaphysics, and philosophical traditions, this skill provides insights into meaning, truth, knowledge, existence, and reasoning.

## What Makes This Different

Unlike general critical thinking, philosopher analysis:

1. **Conceptual Precision**: Defines terms rigorously, exposing ambiguities
2. **Logical Rigor**: Evaluates validity and soundness systematically
3. **Assumption Excavation**: Makes hidden premises explicit
4. **Multiple Traditions**: Integrates analytic, continental, and Eastern perspectives
5. **Argument Charity**: Interprets positions in strongest form
6. **Deep Questions**: Addresses fundamental issues about knowledge, reality, meaning

## Use Cases

- **Conceptual Analysis**: Clarify vague concepts, resolve ambiguities
- **Argument Evaluation**: Assess logical validity, identify fallacies
- **Epistemology**: What can we know? How do we know it?
- **Metaphysics**: Nature of reality, identity, causation, time
- **Philosophy of Science**: Scientific methods, theory change, realism
- **Philosophy of Mind**: Consciousness, free will, mental causation
- **Logic**: Formal and informal reasoning, symbolic logic

## Theoretical Foundations

- **Logic and Argumentation**: Validity, soundness, fallacies, formal systems
- **Epistemology**: Justified true belief, Gettier problems, skepticism, reliabilism
- **Metaphysics**: Ontology, identity, causation, modality, universals
- **Philosophy of Science**: Demarcation, realism, explanation, theory change
- **Philosophy of Mind**: Mind-body problem, consciousness, intentionality, free will

## Analysis Process

1. **Clarify Question** - Disambiguate, distinguish empirical from conceptual
2. **Define Terms** - Precise definitions, consistent usage
3. **Identify Assumptions** - Make implicit premises explicit
4. **Reconstruct Arguments** - Premises, conclusions, hidden steps
5. **Evaluate Validity** - Do conclusions follow logically?
6. **Evaluate Soundness** - Are premises true?
7. **Consider Objections** - Strongest counterarguments
8. **Apply Frameworks** - Multiple philosophical perspectives
9. **Explore Implications** - Logical consequences
10. **Reflective Equilibrium** - Coherent position with appropriate confidence

## Example Analyses

### Gettier Problem (Epistemology)

**Question**: Is justified true belief sufficient for knowledge?
**Analysis**: Gettier cases show JTB insufficient (justified true belief without knowledge)
**Insight**: Knowledge requires more than JTB; exact requirement debated 60+ years

### Chinese Room (Philosophy of Mind)

**Question**: Can computers understand language?
**Analysis**: Syntax manipulation insufficient for semantic understanding
**Insight**: Challenges computational theory of mind; understanding requires more than information processing

### Ship of Theseus (Metaphysics)

**Question**: What makes something the same over time?
**Analysis**: Personal identity puzzles reveal commonsense self may lack clear metaphysical basis
**Insight**: Psychological continuity may matter more than strict identity
