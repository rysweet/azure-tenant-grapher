## Scenario 1: The Ship of Theseus and Personal Identity

**Event Description**:
A person undergoes gradual brain augmentation over 20 years. Initially, a small neural implant assists memory formation (5% of brain function). Over time, more implants replace damaged neural tissue following strokes and degenerative disease. By year 20, 60% of cognitive functions run on synthetic neural processors, seamlessly integrated with remaining biological neurons. The person's memories, personality, and consciousness remain continuous throughout - they feel like "the same person" at each step. However, philosophers debate: Is this still the original person? If biological substrate matters for identity, at what threshold (10%? 50%? 90% replacement) did the original person cease to exist and a new entity begin? If psychological continuity matters, then identity persists regardless of substrate. The case is complicated when, at year 25, the biological brain fails completely and the person's mind runs entirely on synthetic neural networks. Family members must decide whether to maintain the digital consciousness or allow it to end.

**Analysis Task**:
Analyze the philosophical problems of personal identity and persistence over time.

### Expected Analysis Elements

- [ ] **The Ship of Theseus Problem**:
  - Classical formulation: If all parts of a ship are gradually replaced, is it the same ship?
  - Puzzle of persistence: What makes an entity the same entity over time despite change?
  - Gradual vs. sudden replacement: Does rate of change matter?
  - Application: Brain augmentation as biological Theseus ship
  - Paradox: Continuity of experience vs. continuity of substrate

- [ ] **Theories of Personal Identity**:
  - **Psychological continuity theory** (Locke, Parfit): Identity based on memories, beliefs, personality
    - Supports: Person feels continuous, memories/personality intact
    - Problems: Memory can be transferred to new substrate (is that the same person?)
  - **Biological/physical continuity** (animalism): Identity tied to living organism
    - Supports: Bodily continuity matters (brain is biological organ)
    - Problems: Gradual replacement undermines clear biological continuity
  - **Narrative identity** (Ricoeur, MacIntyre): Self as coherent life story
    - Supports: Person's narrative is continuous
    - Problems: Narrative can be preserved in any substrate (even AI)
  - **No-self view** (Buddhist, Hume, Parfit): No enduring self, only bundles of experiences
    - Supports: Avoids reification of "self," accepts change
    - Problems: Conflicts with intuition of persistent identity

- [ ] **Thought Experiments and Intuition Pumps**:
  - Teleportation case (Parfit): If body is destroyed and replica created, is it same person?
  - Brain bisection: If brain split and each half transferred to new body, which is original person?
  - Gradual neuron replacement: Chinese Nation thought experiment (Searle) - functional equivalence
  - Swampman (Davidson): Molecule-for-molecule duplicate created by lightning - is it same person?
  - Fission and fusion cases: What if one person splits into two?

- [ ] **Sorites Paradox (Heap Paradox)**:
  - Classical: Removing one grain from heap doesn't stop it being heap, but eventually it's not a heap
  - Application: Replacing 1% of brain doesn't change identity, but at some point identity changes
  - Vague predicates: "Same person" may lack sharp boundaries
  - Solutions: Accept vagueness (epistemicism, supervaluationism) or deny sharp identity
  - Tolerance principle: Small changes can't affect identity (but accumulate to large change)

- [ ] **Substrate Independence vs. Dependence**:
  - Functionalism: Mental states are functional states (multiple realizability - can run on different substrates)
  - Biological essentialism: Mind requires biological substrate (carbon chauvinism objection)
  - Consciousness and qualia: Can synthetic neurons support phenomenal experience?
  - Uploading: If mind is pattern of information, can it be instantiated in computer?
  - Intuitions diverge: Many accept gradual replacement but reject sudden uploading

- [ ] **Moral and Practical Implications**:
  - Moral status: If identity persists, synthetic person has same moral rights as biological
  - End-of-life decisions: Is "pulling the plug" on digital mind murder? Euthanasia?
  - Legal personhood: Should digital consciousness have legal rights? Inheritance?
  - Family relationships: Are obligations to biological person transferred to synthetic successor?
  - Precautionary approach: Uncertainty about identity suggests caution

- [ ] **Metaphysical Questions**:
  - Persistence conditions: What are necessary and sufficient conditions for identity over time?
  - Diachronic vs. synchronic identity: Same person at different times vs. same person at one time
  - Endurantism vs. perdurantism: Object wholly present at each moment vs. temporal parts
  - Four-dimensionalism: Person as spacetime worm extending through time
  - Conventionalism: "Same person" is conventional, not metaphysical fact

- [ ] **Historical and Philosophical Context**:
  - Theseus' Ship: Plutarch (1st century CE), earliest formulation
  - John Locke: "Essay Concerning Human Understanding" (1689) - memory theory of personal identity
  - David Hume: "Treatise on Human Nature" (1739) - bundle theory, no enduring self
  - Derek Parfit: "Reasons and Persons" (1984) - psychological continuity, reductionism about identity
  - Bernard Williams: "The Self and the Future" (1970) - bodily continuity matters
  - Sydney Shoemaker & Richard Swinburne: "Personal Identity" (1984) - debate
  - Buddhist philosophy: Anatman (no-self) doctrine

## Scenario 2: The Trolley Problem and Doctrine of Double Effect

**Event Description**:
A runaway trolley speeds toward five railway workers who will certainly die if struck. You stand next to a lever that can divert the trolley onto a side track, where it will kill one worker instead. Three related scenarios: (A) You can pull the lever, diverting the trolley to kill one instead of five. (B) You stand on a footbridge above the tracks with a large stranger; pushing them onto the tracks will stop the trolley, saving five but killing the pushed person. (C) You are a doctor with five dying patients needing organs; you could kill one healthy patient and distribute their organs, saving five. Surveys show 90% endorse pulling lever (A), but only 10% endorse pushing (B), and 5% endorse killing for organs (C). Yet all three cases involve killing one to save five - why do moral intuitions diverge?

**Analysis Task**:
Analyze the trolley problem and the moral principles underlying divergent intuitions.

### Expected Analysis Elements

- [ ] **Consequentialist vs. Deontological Frameworks**:
  - **Consequentialism** (utilitarianism): Rightness determined by outcomes (maximize welfare, minimize deaths)
    - Supports lever-pulling, pushing, organ harvesting (all save net 4 lives)
    - Impartial calculation: 5 lives > 1 life
  - **Deontology** (Kantian): Rightness determined by duties, rules, respect for persons
    - Opposes using person as mere means (pushing, organ harvesting violate Kant's Formula of Humanity)
    - Prohibitions against killing (even to save others) take priority
  - Tension: Utilitarian and deontological principles conflict in these cases

- [ ] **Doctrine of Double Effect (DDE)**:
  - Principle: Permissible to cause foreseeable harm as side effect of pursuing good, but not as means
  - Four conditions: (1) Act itself not intrinsically wrong, (2) Good effect intended, bad effect foreseen but not intended, (3) Bad effect not means to good effect, (4) Proportionality (good outweighs bad)
  - **Lever case**: Death of one is side effect (not means) of diverting trolley (satisfies DDE)
  - **Push case**: Death of one is means to stopping trolley (violates DDE)
  - **Organ case**: Killing patient is means to obtaining organs (violates DDE)
  - DDE explains divergent intuitions: Lever pulling permissible, pushing/organ harvesting impermissible

- [ ] **Killing vs. Letting Die Distinction**:
  - Active killing: Directly causing death (pushing, organ harvesting)
  - Passive allowing: Failing to prevent death (not pulling lever = letting five die)
  - Lever case complication: Pulling lever is active intervention, but kills one rather than letting five die
  - Moral relevance: Is there intrinsic moral difference between killing and letting die?
  - Rachels' challenge: Active killing (turning off respirator) vs. passive (not starting respirator) - same outcome, why morally different?

- [ ] **Personal vs. Impersonal Harm**:
  - Contact principle: Direct physical contact (pushing) feels more wrong than remote harm (lever)
  - Psychological distinction: "Up close and personal" violence triggers emotional aversion
  - Evolutionary explanation: Humans evolved strong inhibitions against personal violence
  - Relevance to morality: Is evolutionary psychology a guide to moral truth?
  - Greene's neuroscience: Emotional brain areas activate for personal harm, not impersonal

- [ ] **Using Persons as Means**:
  - Kantian Formula of Humanity: Treat persons as ends in themselves, never merely as means
  - Lever case: One worker is not used as means (death is side effect of track diversion)
  - Push case: Stranger is used as trolley-stopper (instrumentalized)
  - Organ case: Patient is used as organ source (instrumentalized)
  - Rights-based critique: Five do not have right to one person's body/life

- [ ] **Alternative Responses and Critiques**:
  - **Reject intuitions**: Perhaps emotional reactions are unreliable (Unger, Singer)
  - **Threshold deontology**: Allow exceptions to prohibitions when stakes very high
  - **Virtue ethics**: What would virtuous person do? (Context-sensitive, no universal rule)
  - **Care ethics**: Focus on relationships and context, not abstract principles
  - **Particularism**: No universal moral principles, judgments depend on all features of case

- [ ] **Implications and Applications**:
  - Autonomous vehicles: Should AV swerve to minimize casualties? (Trolley problem)
  - Medical triage: Allocate scarce resources to save most lives vs. respect rights
  - Warfare: Collateral damage (DDE applied in just war theory)
  - Public policy: Trade-offs between lives (cost-benefit analysis)
  - Experimental philosophy: Survey responses reveal cultural and individual variation

- [ ] **Historical and Philosophical Context**:
  - Philippa Foot: Introduced trolley problem (1967) to explore DDE
  - Judith Jarvis Thomson: Developed variants (1976, 1985) including footbridge case
  - Thomas Aquinas: Formulated Doctrine of Double Effect (13th century)
  - Immanuel Kant: Categorical Imperative, Formula of Humanity (1785)
  - Bentham & Mill: Utilitarianism (19th century) - consequences matter
  - Frances Kamm: "Trolley Problem Mysteries" (2015) - complex analysis
  - Joshua Greene: Neuroscience of moral judgment (2001+) - dual process theory
  - Peter Singer: Challenges intuitions, defends consequentialism

### Evaluation Criteria

- **Domain Accuracy** (0-10): Correct application of moral philosophy, ethical theories, distinctions
- **Analytical Depth** (0-10): Thoroughness of principle analysis, intuition explanation, implications
- **Insight Specificity** (0-10): Clear philosophical reasoning, specific theory application

## Scenario 3: The Hard Problem of Consciousness

**Event Description**:
Neuroscientists have achieved complete mapping of a human brain's neural activity. They can predict with 99.9% accuracy what a person will report experiencing based on brain states. Given visual cortex activation pattern P1, the person reports seeing "red." Given pattern P2, they report seeing "blue." For any mental state - thoughts, emotions, sensations - there is a corresponding measurable brain state. Despite this predictive success, a philosophical puzzle remains: Why is there subjective experience at all? Why does seeing red feel like something? Why is there "something it is like" to be conscious? Scientists can explain neural correlates of consciousness but not why those neural processes give rise to phenomenal experience (qualia). A philosopher argues: "You've explained the easy problems (how brain processes information, controls behavior) but not the hard problem (why there is subjective experience accompanying those processes)."

**Analysis Task**:
Analyze the hard problem of consciousness and responses from different philosophical positions.

### Expected Analysis Elements

- [ ] **The Hard Problem Formulation** (Chalmers):
  - Easy problems: Explaining cognitive functions (attention, memory, perception, behavior)
    - In principle solvable by neuroscience (mechanistic, computational explanations)
  - Hard problem: Explaining phenomenal consciousness (subjective, first-person experience)
    - Why is there "something it is like" to see red? (Nagel's formulation)
    - Explanatory gap: No obvious bridge from brain states (objective, third-person) to qualia (subjective, first-person)
  - Zombie argument: Conceivable that physical duplicate of person could exist without consciousness (philosophical zombie)

- [ ] **Qualia and Phenomenal Consciousness**:
  - Qualia: Intrinsic, subjective qualities of experience (redness of red, painfulness of pain)
  - Phenomenal vs. access consciousness: Experience vs. reportability
  - Inverted spectrum: Could my "red" experience be your "green" experience? (Private qualia)
  - Knowledge argument (Jackson): Mary the color scientist knows all physical facts about color but learns something new when she sees red (non-physical fact?)
  - Ineffability: Qualia seem impossible to fully communicate in words

- [ ] **Physicalist/Materialist Responses**:
  - **Identity theory**: Mental states are identical to brain states (no explanatory gap)
    - Problem: How can subjective experience be "nothing but" neural firing?
  - **Functionalism**: Mental states are functional states (defined by causal role, not substrate)
    - Problem: Functional isomorphs (e.g., silicon chips) could have same functions but lack qualia
  - **Eliminativism** (Churchland): Qualia are illusion, folk psychology will be eliminated
    - Problem: Denying existence of consciousness seems self-refuting
  - **Type-B materialism** (Block, Carruthers): Gap is epistemic, not metaphysical (we just don't understand yet)

- [ ] **Dualist Responses**:
  - **Substance dualism** (Descartes): Mind and matter are distinct substances
    - Problem: Interaction problem (how do immaterial mind and material brain causally interact?)
  - **Property dualism** (Chalmers): Physical substrate but mental properties are non-physical
    - Qualia as fundamental, irreducible properties of nature (like mass, charge)
    - Avoids interaction problem (properties of same substance)
  - **Panpsychism**: Consciousness is fundamental, present in all matter (even electrons have proto-experience)
    - Combination problem: How do micro-experiences combine into unified human consciousness?

- [ ] **Alternative Frameworks**:
  - **Mysterianism** (McGinn): Humans cognitively closed to understanding consciousness (like dog unable to grasp calculus)
  - **Illusionism** (Frankish): Phenomenal consciousness is cognitive illusion (we introspect inaccurately)
  - **Neutral monism** (Russell, James): Mind and matter are two aspects of neutral underlying reality
  - **Integrated Information Theory** (Tononi): Consciousness is integrated information (Φ) - quantifiable
  - **Global Workspace Theory** (Baars, Dehaene): Consciousness is global availability of information

- [ ] **Methodological and Epistemic Issues**:
  - First-person vs. third-person: Science studies third-person data, consciousness is first-person
  - Neurophenomenology: Integrate first-person reports with neuroscience (Varela)
  - Explanatory gap: Does predictive success constitute explanation? (Correlation vs. causation)
  - Conceptual vs. empirical problem: Is hard problem philosophical or scientific?
  - Zombie conceivability: Is conceivability guide to possibility? (Chalmers yes, Dennett no)

- [ ] **Implications and Applications**:
  - AI consciousness: Could AI have subjective experience? (Functional equivalent but different substrate)
  - Animal consciousness: Do fish, insects, plants have qualia? (Moral implications)
  - Moral status: Is phenomenal consciousness necessary for moral consideration?
  - Mind uploading: If mind transferred to computer, would it be conscious?
  - Anesthesia: What happens to consciousness? (Suspended or absent?)

- [ ] **Historical and Philosophical Context**:
  - René Descartes: "Meditations" (1641) - mind-body dualism
  - Thomas Nagel: "What Is It Like to Be a Bat?" (1974) - subjective character of experience
  - Frank Jackson: "Epiphenomenal Qualia" (1982) - Knowledge argument
  - David Chalmers: "The Conscious Mind" (1996) - formulated hard problem
  - Daniel Dennett: "Consciousness Explained" (1991) - rejects qualia
  - Joseph Levine: "Materialism and qualia: The explanatory gap" (1983)
  - John Searle: Chinese Room argument (1980) - syntax vs. semantics
  - Giulio Tononi: Integrated Information Theory (2000s)

## Scenario 4: The Gettier Problem and Nature of Knowledge

**Event Description**:
A farmer checks on his sheep in a distant field. He sees a white, fluffy, sheep-shaped object and forms the belief "There is a sheep in the field." Based on this justified, true belief, he reports to his neighbor that his sheep is safe. It turns out: (1) There IS a sheep in the field (true), (2) The farmer is justified in believing this (he saw what looked like a sheep), (3) BUT what he saw was actually a dog covered in wool; the real sheep was hidden behind a rock. So the farmer has justified true belief but seems to lack knowledge. Classical definition of knowledge: Justified True Belief (JTB). Gettier cases challenge this: JTB is not sufficient for knowledge. Another case: Smith believes "Jones owns a Ford OR Brown is in Barcelona" because he has strong evidence Jones owns a Ford (saw him driving it, has title papers). Smith has no idea where Brown is but adds disjunction to make compound statement. It turns out Jones doesn't own a Ford (was borrowing it), but by luck, Brown IS in Barcelona. Smith's belief is true and justified but seems accidental, not knowledge.

**Analysis Task**:
Analyze the Gettier problem and responses attempting to salvage or revise the definition of knowledge.

### Expected Analysis Elements

- [ ] **Classical Justified True Belief (JTB) Account**:
  - Three conditions for knowledge: (1) Belief (psychological state), (2) Truth (correspondence to reality), (3) Justification (epistemic grounds)
  - Plato's "Theaetetus": Early formulation (knowledge is true belief with an account/logos)
  - Standard analysis: JTB was consensus definition pre-Gettier (1963)
  - Intuitive appeal: Knowledge requires truth (not falsehood), justification (not lucky guess), and belief (not mere information storage)

- [ ] **Gettier's Counterexamples**:
  - Sheep/dog case: JTB present, but knowledge absent (lucky that belief is true)
  - Ford/Barcelona case: Justification based on false lemma (Jones owns Ford), conclusion true by accident
  - Structure: Justified belief formed on basis of false evidence, true by luck
  - Epistemic luck: Belief is true not because of justification but by fortunate coincidence
  - General pattern: JTB does not rule out epistemic luck

- [ ] **Responses - Adding Fourth Condition**:
  - **No false lemmas** (Clark, Ginet): Justification must not rely on any false intermediary beliefs
    - Sheep case: Belief justified via false lemma "That is a sheep" (really a dog)
    - Problem: What if justification indirectly involves false beliefs? (Infinite regress of checking lemmas)
  - **Defeasibility** (Lehrer): No true fact that, if added to justification, would defeat it
    - Sheep case: Fact "What farmer saw was a dog" would defeat justification
    - Problem: Complicated to specify which facts are relevant defeaters
  - **Causal connection** (Goldman): Belief must be caused by the fact that makes it true
    - Sheep case: Belief not caused by actual sheep (caused by dog)
    - Problem: Causal theory has own difficulties (perception, abstract objects)

- [ ] **Reliabilism** (Goldman):
  - Knowledge requires belief formed by reliable process (high truth-to-belief ratio)
  - Sheep case: Perception is generally reliable, but in this instance produced false belief (dog misidentified)
  - Generality problem: How to specify relevant reference class? (Perception in general? Perception of distant fluffy objects?)
  - New evil demon problem: Reliable processes in demon world don't produce knowledge (truth condition violated)

- [ ] **Virtue Epistemology** (Sosa, Zagzebski):
  - Knowledge is belief arising from intellectual virtues (abilities, character traits)
  - Animal knowledge (reliabilism) vs. reflective knowledge (understanding one's justification)
  - Sheep case: Farmer's belief doesn't manifest cognitive virtue (perceptual ability undermined by distance/disguise)
  - Advantage: Explains why Gettier cases aren't knowledge (success not due to ability)

- [ ] **Contextualism** (DeRose, Cohen):
  - "Knowledge" has different standards in different contexts
  - In everyday context, farmer might count as knowing; in skeptical context, no
  - Gettier cases exploit context-shifting intuitions
  - Problem: Seems to relativize knowledge to conversational context (counterintuitive?)

- [ ] **Skeptical Response**:
  - Gettier problem shows JTB analysis was fundamentally misguided
  - Knowledge may be primitive, unanalyzable concept
  - Or: Knowledge is too context-dependent and interest-relative to admit precise definition
  - Pragmatic shift: Focus on epistemic norms and practices, not definition

- [ ] **Implications for Epistemology**:
  - Epistemic luck: Problem extends beyond Gettier (lottery cases, environmental luck)
  - Internalism vs. externalism: Must justification be accessible to subject? (Reliability is external)
  - Social epistemology: Testimony, authority, collective knowledge (Gettier cases involve trust)
  - Applied epistemology: Scientific knowledge, legal evidence (standards of justification)

- [ ] **Historical and Philosophical Context**:
  - Plato: "Theaetetus" (4th century BCE) - JTB account proposed and critiqued
  - Edmund Gettier: "Is Justified True Belief Knowledge?" (1963) - 3-page paper, revolutionized epistemology
  - Bertrand Russell: Stopped clock case (earlier Gettier-like example)
  - Alvin Goldman: "A Causal Theory of Knowing" (1967) - causal response
  - Ernest Sosa: "The Raft and the Pyramid" (1980) - foundationalism vs. coherentism
  - Keith Lehrer & Thomas Paxson: "Knowledge: Undefeated Justified True Belief" (1969)
  - Timothy Williamson: "Knowledge and Its Limits" (2000) - knowledge as primitive

### Evaluation Criteria

- **Domain Accuracy** (0-10): Correct application of epistemology concepts, JTB, Gettier cases
- **Analytical Depth** (0-10): Thoroughness of problem analysis, response evaluation
- **Insight Specificity** (0-10): Clear philosophical reasoning, specific theory distinctions

## Scenario 5: Free Will, Determinism, and Moral Responsibility

**Event Description**:
A person commits a violent crime. Neuroscientists scan their brain and discover abnormalities in the prefrontal cortex (impulse control) and amygdala (emotion regulation) due to childhood trauma and genetic predisposition. The defense attorney argues: "Given the defendant's brain state and history, they could not have done otherwise. Their action was causally determined by prior factors outside their control. Therefore, they are not morally responsible and should not be punished, only treated." The prosecution responds: "Determinism is irrelevant. The defendant had reasons, deliberated, and acted. They are a rational agent capable of responding to incentives. Punishment is justified to deter future crime and hold agents accountable." A compatibilist philosopher testifies: "Free will is compatible with determinism. What matters is whether the person acted according to their own desires and beliefs, free from external coercion. Internal causation by one's own psychology is sufficient for responsibility." A libertarian philosopher counters: "True moral responsibility requires libertarian free will - the ability to have done otherwise in exactly the same circumstances. Without indeterministic agency, we are just sophisticated automatons."

**Analysis Task**:
Analyze the free will debate and its implications for moral responsibility and criminal justice.

### Expected Analysis Elements

- [ ] **Hard Determinism**:
  - Thesis: All events (including human actions) are causally determined by prior states and natural laws
  - Incompatibilism: Free will and determinism are incompatible
  - Consequence: No one has free will, no one is morally responsible (in desert-based sense)
  - Arguments: Neuroscience, physics (Laplace's demon), psychological determinism
  - Implication: Retributive punishment unjustified (but may accept consequentialist deterrence)

- [ ] **Libertarian Free Will**:
  - Thesis: Free will requires indeterminism (agent causation not determined by prior states)
  - Incompatibilism: Agrees with hard determinism that free will and determinism incompatible
  - Assertion: Humans DO have free will (contra hard determinism)
  - Source: Agent causation, quantum indeterminacy in brain, irreducible agency
  - Problem: Randomness (quantum indeterminacy) doesn't seem like control (luck objection)
  - Implication: Moral responsibility requires libertarian free will

- [ ] **Compatibilism** (Hume, Frankfurt, Dennett):
  - Thesis: Free will is compatible with determinism
  - Free will redefined: Acting according to one's own desires, beliefs, values (internal causation)
  - Unfree: External coercion, compulsion, manipulation (not caused by one's true self)
  - "Could have done otherwise": Hypothetical sense (would have acted differently if desires/beliefs were different)
  - Implication: Moral responsibility compatible with determinism

- [ ] **Frankfurt Cases and Hierarchical Views**:
  - Harry Frankfurt: Free will is second-order volition (desires about desires)
  - Person acts freely if they identify with their first-order desires
  - Frankfurt case: Alternative possibilities not necessary for responsibility (Black ensures Jones does A, but Jones does A on his own anyway)
  - Hierarchical self: True self vs. alienated desires (addiction, compulsion)

- [ ] **Moral Responsibility Conditions**:
  - Desert-based: Person deserves praise/blame, punishment/reward
  - Consequentialist: Responsibility attributions are useful for behavior regulation (forward-looking)
  - Strawsonian (reactive attitudes): Responsibility grounded in interpersonal relationships, emotions (resentment, gratitude)
  - Reasons-responsiveness (Fischer & Ravizza): Responsible if agent is responsive to moral reasons

- [ ] **Neuroscience and Legal Implications**:
  - Brain abnormalities: Prefrontal cortex damage reduces impulse control (Phineas Gage case)
  - Genetic/environmental determinism: Childhood trauma, genes influence behavior
  - Mitigation vs. exculpation: Brain evidence can reduce but not eliminate responsibility?
  - Slippery slope: If brain causes behavior, no one is responsible (hard determinist worry)
  - Pragmatic: Criminal law assumes responsibility, adjusts for diminished capacity

- [ ] **Alternative Frameworks**:
  - **Semi-compatibilism** (Fischer): Moral responsibility doesn't require alternative possibilities, but does require reasons-responsiveness
  - **Hard incompatibilism** (Pereboom): Neither determinism nor indeterminism support moral responsibility
  - **Illusionism** (Smilansky): Free will is illusion, but necessary illusion for social stability
  - **Revisionism**: Abandon desert-based responsibility, adopt purely consequentialist justifications for punishment

- [ ] **Implications for Criminal Justice**:
  - Retributive punishment: Justification undermined if no free will (hard determinist, hard incompatibilist)
  - Deterrence and rehabilitation: Justified on consequentialist grounds (compatible with determinism)
  - Restorative justice: Focus on repair and reconciliation (less reliant on blame)
  - Predictive sentencing: If behavior determined, predict and prevent (but ethical concerns)
  - Responsibility as social construct: Pragmatic tool for social coordination

- [ ] **Historical and Philosophical Context**:
  - Aristotle: "Nicomachean Ethics" (4th century BCE) - voluntary action
  - David Hume: "Enquiry Concerning Human Understanding" (1748) - compatibilism
  - Immanuel Kant: "Critique of Practical Reason" (1788) - noumenal self, transcendental freedom
  - Pierre-Simon Laplace: Demon thought experiment (1814) - determinism
  - P.F. Strawson: "Freedom and Resentment" (1962) - reactive attitudes
  - Harry Frankfurt: "Freedom of the Will" (1971) - hierarchical account
  - Daniel Dennett: "Elbow Room" (1984) - compatibilism defense
  - Derk Pereboom: "Living Without Free Will" (2001) - hard incompatibilism
  - Benjamin Libet: Neuroscience experiments (1980s) - unconscious initiation of action

## Using This Quiz

### For Self-Assessment

1. Attempt each scenario analysis
2. Compare your analysis to expected elements
3. Score yourself honestly on each dimension
4. Identify areas for improvement

### For Automated Testing (Claude Agent SDK)

```python
from claude_agent_sdk import Agent, TestHarness

agent = Agent.load("philosopher-analyst")
quiz = load_quiz_scenarios("tests/quiz.md")

results = []
for scenario in quiz.scenarios:
    analysis = agent.analyze(scenario.event)
    score = evaluate_analysis(analysis, scenario.expected_elements)
    results.append({"scenario": scenario.name, "score": score})

assert sum(r["score"] for r in results) >= 175  # Overall passing
assert sum(1 for r in results if r["score"] >= 35) >= 4  # At least 4 scenarios pass
```

### For Continuous Improvement

- Add new scenarios as philosophical debates evolve
- Update expected elements as philosophical literature develops
- Refine scoring criteria based on analyst performance patterns
- Use failures to improve philosopher analyst skill
