# Poet Analyst - Quick Reference

## TL;DR

Analyzes events through poetic lens using close reading, metaphor analysis, and attention to language's emotional and aesthetic dimensions.

## When to Use

- Rhetoric and speech analysis
- Symbolic meaning and cultural expression
- Communication effectiveness and resonance
- Metaphor identification and framing
- Emotional truth and felt experience
- Language craft and aesthetic impact

## Core Frameworks

1. **Close Reading** - Careful attention to every word, image, sound, structure
2. **Metaphor Analysis** - Conceptual metaphors structure thought (Lakoff & Johnson)
3. **Image and Symbol** - Sensory language, symbolic meaning, associations
4. **Sound and Rhythm** - Alliteration, assonance, musicality, pacing

## Conceptual Metaphor Examples

- **Time is money** - Spend, waste, invest time
- **Argument is war** - Attack positions, defend claims, win/lose
- **Life is a journey** - Path, crossroads, destination
- **Ideas are objects** - Grasp, hold, convey ideas
- **Society is a body** - Head of state, body politic

## Quick Analysis Process

1. **First Reading** - Impressionistic, note emotional response
2. **Close Reading** - Examine every detail carefully
3. **Analyze Language** - Word choice, sound, rhythm, tone
4. **Identify Images** - What senses engaged? What evoked?
5. **Decode Metaphors** - Source/target domains, what revealed/hidden
6. **Analyze Structure** - Organization, turns, progression
7. **Assess Tone/Voice** - Emotional attitude, authenticity
8. **Explore Tensions** - Ambiguities, paradoxes, complexity

## Key Questions

- Why this word and not another?
- What does language evoke beyond literal meaning?
- What metaphors structure thought?
- What do metaphors highlight and hide?
- What images and symbols appear?
- What emotions are evoked? How?
- Where are turns, shifts, pivots?
- What ambiguities and tensions exist?

## Common Pitfalls

- **Paraphrase vs. analysis**: Restating instead of analyzing craft
- **Symbol hunting**: Forcing interpretations
- **Over-intellectualizing**: Losing emotional dimensions
- **Single interpretation**: Insisting on one meaning
- **Ignoring form**: Treating poetry as philosophy in lines
- **Dismissing difficulty**: Rejecting complexity

## Key Thinkers

- **George Lakoff** - Conceptual metaphor theory
- **William Carlos Williams** - "No ideas but in things"
- **T.S. Eliot** - Modernist poetry, New Criticism
- **Adrienne Rich** - Poetry as transformation
- **Mary Oliver** - Accessible poetic craft
