# Poet Analyst Skill

> **Analyze events through the lens of poetry and poetics to understand language's emotional and aesthetic dimensions, metaphorical meaning, and expressive power.**

## Overview

The Poet Analyst skill enables Claude to perform sophisticated analysis of language, rhetoric, and communication, applying close reading methods, metaphor analysis, and attention to how things are said. Drawing on poetic traditions and linguistic theory, this skill provides insights into:

- **Metaphor and Symbol**: Conceptual metaphors, symbolic meaning, imagery
- **Emotional Truth**: Feelings, mood, unspoken dimensions beyond facts
- **Language Craft**: Diction, sound, rhythm, tone, voice
- **Rhetoric and Framing**: How language shapes perception and thought
- **Aesthetic Impact**: Beauty, power, resonance of expression
- **Ambiguity and Complexity**: Multiple meanings, productive tensions

## What Makes This Different

Unlike general analysis, poet analysis:

1. **Focuses on How, Not Just What**: Attends to how things are said
2. **Applies Close Reading**: Careful attention to every word, image, sound
3. **Decodes Metaphors**: Reveals underlying conceptual structures
4. **Accesses Emotion**: Feeling as a way of knowing
5. **Values Ambiguity**: Multiple meanings reflect complexity
6. **Analyzes Craft**: Form, structure, sound create meaning

### Metaphor Analysis

- **Conceptual Metaphors**: Abstract understood through concrete (e.g., "Time is money")
- **Source and Target Domains**: Mapping between concrete and abstract
- **What Metaphors Reveal/Hide**: Frame attention, shape understanding
- **Alternative Metaphors**: Different frames, different implications

### Language Elements

- **Diction**: Word choice, connotation, precision
- **Tone**: Emotional attitude toward subject
- **Voice**: Distinctive personality, authenticity
- **Imagery**: Sensory language, concrete details
- **Compression**: Saying more with less, implication

### Structural Tools

- **The Turn (Volta)**: Moment of change, reversal, insight
- **Tension and Paradox**: Holding contradictions productively
- **Concrete and Abstract**: Grounding ideas in particulars
- **Pattern Recognition**: Repetition, variation, progression

## Quick Start

### Basic Usage

```
Claude, use the poet-analyst skill to analyze [SPEECH/STATEMENT/LANGUAGE].

Examples:
- "Use poet-analyst to analyze this political speech's metaphors."
- "Analyze the company's mission statement language using poet-analyst."
- "Use the poet skill to understand why this slogan resonates."
```

### Advanced Usage

Specify particular frameworks or focus areas:

```
"Use poet-analyst to decode the metaphors in this leadership communication."

"Apply poet-analyst with close reading to analyze this cultural moment's language."

"Use poet-analyst to examine the emotional impact of this movement's poetry."
```

## Analysis Process

The poet analyst follows a systematic 10-step process:

1. **First Encounter** - Read impressionistically, note emotional response
2. **Close Reading** - Examine every word, phrase, image carefully
3. **Analyze Language** - Diction, sound, rhythm, precision
4. **Identify Images/Symbols** - Sensory language, symbolic meaning
5. **Decode Metaphors** - Source/target domains, what revealed/hidden
6. **Analyze Structure** - Form, organization, turns, progression
7. **Assess Tone and Voice** - Emotional attitude, authenticity
8. **Explore Tensions** - Contradictions, paradoxes, complexity
9. **Contextualize** - Historical, cultural, literary background
10. **Synthesize Interpretation** - Integrate findings, articulate impact

## Example Analyses

### Example 1: Political Speech Metaphor

**Text**: "We stand at a crossroads... One road leads into darkness—the path of fear. The other climbs toward the light—the road of hope. We must choose to climb."

**Poetic Analysis**:

- **Conceptual Metaphor**: "Politics is a journey," "Future is a destination"
- **Source Domain**: Physical journey, roads, climbing
- **Highlights**: Agency (we choose), moral clarity (light/dark), progress (climbing)
- **Hides**: Policy complexity, that "roads" implies predetermined destinations
- **Symbols**: Light (hope/knowledge), darkness (fear/ignorance), climbing (effort/achievement)
- **Effect**: Emotionally resonant, creates moral imperative, simplifies choice

**Insight**: Journey metaphor emphasizes agency and progress; light/dark adds moral dimension; effective but simplifies complexity

### Example 2: Organizational Language

**Metaphors Used**: "Journey to future," "Building foundation," "Navigating uncharted waters," "Climbing mountain"

**Analysis**: Multiple conflicting metaphors create confusion. Journey implies movement, building implies staying; charted journey vs. uncharted waters contradicts.

**Recommendation**: Choose ONE metaphor and develop consistently for clarity and confidence.

### Example 3: Movement Poetry

**Text**: "We are the ones we've been waiting for... Our voices, rising like bread..."

**Poetic Analysis**:

- **Brilliant Metaphor**: "Voices rising like bread" - unexpected, organic, inevitable expansion, nourishment
- **Structure**: Assertion → embodiment → defiance
- **Tone**: Confident, collective, urgent
- **Language**: Simple, concrete (calloused hands, bodies spelling freedom)
- **Why It Resonates**: Emotional truth, concrete imagery, rhythmic power, collective voice
