## Scenario 1: Analysis of a Contemporary Protest Poem

**Event Description**:
A viral poem emerges during social unrest, shared millions of times across social media. The poem uses sparse language, fragmented syntax, and concrete urban imagery. It alternates between first-person plural ("we") and second-person address ("you"), creating tension between collective identity and accusation. The poem employs repetition of the phrase "not again" as both refrain and escalation. Imagery includes: broken glass, sirens, breath, hands raised, mothers weeping, streets on fire. The form breaks traditional stanza structure, using white space strategically. Line breaks fragment sentences mid-thought, creating urgency and breathlessness. The poem ends mid-sentence, without resolution.

**Analysis Task**:
Provide comprehensive literary and poetic analysis of this work's craft, meaning, and cultural significance.

### Expected Analysis Elements

- [ ] **Formal Analysis - Craft Elements**:
  - Line breaks: Enjambment creating tension, breath control, pacing
  - White space: Strategic use for pause, silence, absence
  - Syntax fragmentation: Reflects chaos, urgency, trauma
  - Lack of punctuation: Run-on effect, breathlessness, continuous movement
  - Open ending: Resistance to closure, ongoing nature of struggle

- [ ] **Sound & Music** (Prosody):
  - Repetition as incantation and intensification ("not again")
  - Assonance and consonance in concrete nouns (glass, breath, hands)
  - Rhythm: Irregular, staccato, mimics heartbeat or sirens
  - Absence of rhyme: Rejection of traditional form, authenticity
  - Oral quality: Written for speaking/chanting

  - Mothers weeping: Generational pain, innocence lost

- [ ] **Voice & Perspective**:
  - "We" as collective identity: Community, solidarity, shared experience
  - "You" as direct address: Confrontation, accountability, witnessing demanded
  - Shifting pronouns: Fluidity between victim, witness, accuser
  - Intimacy and distance: Personal yet political

- [ ] **Emotional Architecture**:
  - Grief layered with rage
  - Exhaustion ("not again") vs. urgency (fragmented syntax)
  - Trauma and testimony

## Scenario 2: Ekphrastic Response to Abstract Visual Art

**Event Description**:
A poet is commissioned to write an ekphrastic poem (poetry about art) in response to a large-scale abstract painting. The painting is predominantly blue and grey, with sharp diagonal slashes of red and gold. The texture is heavily layered, with visible brushstrokes and areas where paint has been scraped away to reveal under-layers. The composition creates a sense of movement from upper left to lower right. The painting's title is "Threshold." The poet produces a 30-line poem that never explicitly describes the painting but captures its emotional essence. The poem uses water imagery (rivers, rain, drowning, baptism), light imagery (dawn, ember, extinguished), and architectural imagery (doorway, bridge, edge, crossing). The poem's form is three ten-line stanzas with irregular line lengths, creating visual shape on the page that echoes the diagonal movement of the painting.

**Analysis Task**:
Analyze the relationship between the visual art and the poem, evaluating the ekphrastic translation.

### Expected Analysis Elements

- [ ] **Ekphrastic Tradition & Approach**:
  - Types: Descriptive vs. interpretive vs. transformative
  - This poem: Transformative/interpretive (translates feeling, not appearance)
  - Historical context: From Homer's shield to contemporary visual-verbal dialogue
  - The "indescribability" strategy: What can't be captured in words

- [ ] **Visual-to-Verbal Translation**:
  - Color translation: Blue/grey → water imagery; red/gold → light/fire imagery
  - Movement: Diagonal slash → river flow, crossing, threshold passage
  - Texture: Layered paint → layered meanings, palimpsest effect in language
  - Spatial composition: Visual diagonal → stanza shape and line length variation
  - Title integration: "Threshold" expanded into liminal imagery throughout

- [ ] **Metaphoric System**:
  - Water as transition, flux, danger, cleansing
  - Light as hope, revelation, memory, fading
  - Architecture as in-between spaces, crossing points
  - Coherent through-line: All imagery serves "threshold" concept
  - Synaesthesia: Visual experience rendered through multiple senses

- [ ] **Formal Correspondence**:
  - Three stanzas mirror tripartite composition of painting
  - Line length variation creates visual diagonal on page
  - Enjambment creates forward motion (echoes painting's directionality)
  - Irregular meter suggests texture, roughness of brushwork
  - White space between stanzas as "scraped away" areas

- [ ] **Poetic Independence**:
  - Poem stands alone without seeing painting
  - Creates its own imagistic world while honoring source
  - Not mere description or illustration
  - Adds interpretive layer: "Threshold" as life transition, spiritual passage

- [ ] **Emotional Resonance**:
  - Captures painting's mood: Liminal, uncertain, powerful
  - Tension between danger (drowning) and transformation (baptism)
  - Melancholy with hints of transcendence (ember/dawn)
  - Reader experiences similar emotional arc as viewer of painting

- [ ] **Literary Craft**:
  - Precision of diction (each word choice justified)
  - Sound patterns reinforcing meaning (liquid sounds for water, hard stops for threshold)
  - Balance of concrete and abstract
  - Control of pacing through syntax and lineation

### Evaluation Criteria

- **Domain Accuracy** (0-10): Correct understanding of ekphrastic tradition, visual-verbal translation
- **Analytical Depth** (0-10): Thoroughness of form, metaphor, correspondence analysis
- **Insight Specificity** (0-10): Clear identification of translation strategies and their success
- **Historical/Contextual Grounding** (0-10): References to ekphrastic tradition, precedents
- **Reasoning Clarity** (0-10): Logical flow from visual elements to verbal equivalents to evaluation

**Minimum Passing Score**: 35/50

## Scenario 3: Experimental Form - Erasure Poetry from Legal Document

**Event Description**:
A poet creates an erasure poem from a historical Supreme Court decision on civil rights. The process involves taking the original legal text and selectively removing words to create a new poem from the remaining fragments. The resulting poem is 15 lines, preserving the original word order but with vast gaps. The visual presentation shows the full legal document with most words blacked out, leaving the poem visible through the redaction. Key phrases that remain include: "equal protection," "inherently unequal," "hearts and minds," "cannot be undone," "we conclude," "separate," "forever." The erasure reveals an emotional core hidden within bureaucratic language. The form itself comments on what legal language conceals and reveals, on violence of exclusion, and on recovery of human meaning from institutional text.

**Analysis Task**:
Analyze the erasure poem's craft, meaning-making process, and political/artistic implications.

### Expected Analysis Elements

- [ ] **Erasure as Poetic Method**:
  - Historical context: Found poetry, Blackout poetry (Newspaper Blackout, Austin Kleon)
  - Literary precedents: Tom Phillips' "A Humument," Srikanth Reddy's "Voyager"
  - Conceptual poetry movement: Appropriation, non-original composition
  - Ethical dimensions: Whose voice? Whose authority?

- [ ] **Source Material Analysis**:
  - Legal language characteristics: Passive voice, abstraction, authority
  - Court decision as palimpsest: Official narrative containing other stories
  - Irony: Using oppressive language to critique oppression
  - Historical violence embedded in legal neutrality

- [ ] **Poetic Excavation**:
  - What remains vs. what's removed: Strategic choices
  - "Hearts and minds" - humanizing phrase within legal framework
  - "Inherently unequal" - damning admission preserved
  - "Cannot be undone" - permanence of harm acknowledged
  - "Separate" - single word holding weight of segregation
  - Juxtapositions created by gaps

- [ ] **Visual/Material Poetics**:
  - Page as artwork: Typography, blackout marks, negative space
  - Violence of redaction mimics violence of law
  - Visibility/invisibility: What's shown vs. hidden
  - Reader as archeologist: Reconstructing meaning through fragments
  - Document's authority undermined by intervention

- [ ] **Semantic & Syntactic Analysis**:
  - Fragmentation disrupts legal certainty
  - New syntax from gaps: Meaning emerges from absence
  - Word order preservation vs. contextual transformation
  - Ambiguity replacing legal precision (poetic vs. legal language)

- [ ] **Political & Ethical Dimensions**:
  - Power: Who has right to remake authoritative texts?
  - Resistance: Poetry as counter-narrative to official history
  - Recovery: Finding human pain in bureaucratic language
  - Complicity: Using oppressor's language (critique or appropriation?)
  - Contemporary relevance: Legal system's ongoing failures

- [ ] **Reader Experience**:
  - Active reading: Filling gaps, imagining full document
  - Dual consciousness: Poem and source simultaneously present
  - Emotional impact: Fragmentation mirrors trauma
  - Critical distance: Form encourages questioning authority

### Evaluation Criteria

- **Domain Accuracy** (0-10): Correct understanding of erasure poetry, conceptual poetics, found poetry
- **Analytical Depth** (0-10): Thoroughness of method, material, political analysis
- **Insight Specificity** (0-10): Clear identification of strategic choices and their effects
- **Historical/Contextual Grounding** (0-10): References to erasure tradition, conceptual poetry movement
- **Reasoning Clarity** (0-10): Logical flow from form to meaning to political implications

**Minimum Passing Score**: 35/50

## Scenario 4: Translation Analysis - Poem Across Languages and Cultures

**Event Description**:
A celebrated Arabic poem from the 9th century by Abu Nuwas (known for wine poetry and homoerotic themes) is newly translated into English by three different translators. The original uses classical Arabic forms (qasida), elaborate metaphor (wine as divine intoxication, beloved's beauty through natural imagery), and wordplay impossible to preserve in English. The original also operates within specific cultural context: Abbasid court culture, Sufi mysticism, Arabic prosodic tradition.

**Translator A**: Prioritizes formal equivalence, maintains rhyme scheme (though different from original), uses archaic English ("thee," "thy") to suggest historical distance.

**Translator B**: Prioritizes semantic accuracy, free verse, extensive footnotes explaining cultural context, literal translations of metaphors with explanations.

**Translator C**: Prioritizes contemporary resonance, modern idiom, adapts cultural references to American contexts, captures emotional/sensual essence over literal meaning.

**Analysis Task**:
Analyze the translation approaches, evaluate successes and losses, and explore what translation reveals about poetry's translatability.

### Expected Analysis Elements

- [ ] **Translation Theory Frameworks**:
  - Formal equivalence vs. dynamic equivalence
  - Foreignization vs. domestication (Venuti)
  - Untranslatability: What cannot cross languages
  - Translation as interpretation and creative act
  - Walter Benjamin's "The Task of the Translator"

- [ ] **Source Text Challenges**:
  - Classical Arabic prosody: Quantitative meter, monorhyme
  - Calligraphic/visual dimension of Arabic poetry
  - Polysemy: Arabic root system creating layered meanings
  - Cultural embeddedness: Wine in Islamic context, homoeroticism
  - Intertextuality: References to Quranic language, prior poetry

- [ ] **Translator A Analysis - Formal Approach**:
  - **Gains**: Maintains musicality, suggests original's formal constraints
  - **Losses**: Archaic diction creates false historicity, different rhyme distorts sound
  - **Effect**: Readable but domesticates into familiar "old poetry" template
  - **Ethical question**: Does "thee/thy" Orientalize or honor distance?

- [ ] **Translator B Analysis - Scholarly Approach**:
  - **Gains**: Semantic accuracy, cultural education, transparency about choices
  - **Losses**: Poetry becomes anthropology, footnotes interrupt reading
  - **Effect**: Accurate but not poetic; reader as student, not experiencer
  - **Value**: Reference text for other translators, scholars

- [ ] **Translator C Analysis - Adaptive Approach**:
  - **Gains**: Emotional immediacy, contemporary relevance, living poem
  - **Losses**: Cultural specificity erased, appropriation risk, original context lost
  - **Effect**: New poem inspired by original rather than translation
  - **Ethical question**: Is this translation or adaptation?

- [ ] **Comparative Insight**:
  - No "correct" translation exists
  - Each reveals different aspect of original
  - Translation impossibility is generative (multiple versions enrich understanding)
  - Ideal reader: Reads all three + learns Arabic
  - Poetry as that which is lost in translation (Frost)

- [ ] **Broader Implications**:
  - Power dynamics: English as dominant translation target
  - Canon formation: Translation as gatekeeping (what gets translated shapes world literature)
  - Cultural exchange vs. appropriation
  - Translation as creative renewal of original
  - Multilingual poetics: Code-switching, translingual writing

### Evaluation Criteria

- **Domain Accuracy** (0-10): Correct understanding of translation theory, poetic forms, cultural contexts
- **Analytical Depth** (0-10): Thoroughness of comparative analysis, gains/losses assessment
- **Insight Specificity** (0-10): Clear evaluation of each approach's successes and failures
- **Historical/Contextual Grounding** (0-10): References to translation theory, Arabic poetic tradition
- **Reasoning Clarity** (0-10): Logical comparison and nuanced judgment

**Minimum Passing Score**: 35/50

## Scenario 5: Anthology Curation - Defining a Poetic Movement

**Event Description**:
You are curating an anthology titled "Ecopoetics: Poetry of Climate Disruption (2010-2025)." You must select 30 poems from hundreds of candidates that define this emerging poetic movement. Candidate poems vary widely: some use scientific language and data, others focus on personal climate anxiety, some experiment with form to mirror ecological systems, others employ traditional nature poetry conventions. Some are direct and activist, others oblique and meditative. Poets come from diverse backgrounds - indigenous poets writing about land loss, urban poets addressing heat islands, coastal poets documenting erosion, poets from Global South experiencing climate violence firsthand. You must make selection and ordering choices that define the movement's aesthetic, political stance, and formal innovations while ensuring diverse voices and approaches.

    - Risk of obscurity vs. risk of sentimentality
  - **Tension 3 - Tone & Affect**:
    - Climate grief vs. resilience narratives
    - Accusation vs. invitation
    - Apocalyptic vs. pragmatic vs. utopian
  - **Tension 4 - Science & Poetry**:
    - Integration of data, terminology vs. metaphoric tradition
    - Authority: Poet as witness vs. scientist-poet

- [ ] **Organizational Structure**:
  - Thematic sections vs. chronological vs. formal groupings?
  - Progression: Descent into crisis → emergence? Or non-linear chaos?
  - Juxtapositions: Placing poems in conversation
  - Opening and closing poems: Framing the whole

- [ ] **Specific Poem Type Considerations**:
