# Ethicist Analyst Skill

> **Analyze moral dimensions and value conflicts through rigorous ethical frameworks to guide defensible decision-making.**

## Overview

The Ethicist Analyst skill enables Claude to perform sophisticated moral analysis of decisions, policies, and technologies. Drawing on established philosophical frameworks, ethical principles, and rigorous reasoning methods, this skill provides insights into:

- **Ethical Frameworks**: Apply deontology, consequentialism, virtue ethics, care ethics, justice theories
- **Value Conflicts**: Identify and analyze tensions between competing moral principles
- **Stakeholder Analysis**: Systematically consider all affected parties and their interests
- **Rights and Duties**: Clarify moral obligations and entitlements
- **Causal Assessment**: Evaluate consequences and their moral significance
- **Practical Guidance**: Recommend ethically defensible courses of action

## What Makes This Different

Unlike general moral reasoning, ethicist analysis:

1. **Multi-Framework**: Applies multiple ethical theories systematically, not just intuition
2. **Rigorous Justification**: Provides logical arguments, tests for consistency and universalizability
3. **Stakeholder Inclusive**: Centers vulnerable and marginalized voices often ignored
4. **Acknowledges Complexity**: Recognizes genuine value conflicts with no perfect solutions
5. **Transparent Trade-offs**: Makes moral costs and benefits explicit
6. **Practically Actionable**: Provides concrete guidance, not just abstract theorizing

## Ethical Frameworks Available

### Core Theoretical Approaches

- **Deontological Ethics (Kant)**: Duty-based reasoning, categorical imperative, respect for persons
- **Consequentialism (Mill, Singer)**: Outcome-based reasoning, utilitarianism, effective altruism
- **Virtue Ethics (Aristotle)**: Character-based reasoning, moral exemplars, practical wisdom
- **Care Ethics (Gilligan, Noddings)**: Relational ethics, contextual reasoning, vulnerability
- **Justice Theory (Rawls)**: Fairness, veil of ignorance, distributive justice

### Applied Frameworks

- **Four Principles (Bioethics)**: Autonomy, beneficence, non-maleficence, justice
- **Rights Analysis**: Negative/positive rights, human rights, legal vs. moral rights
- **Stakeholder Analysis**: Identifying affected parties, power dynamics, vulnerability
- **Double Effect Reasoning**: Intended vs. foreseen consequences
- **Casuistry**: Case-based reasoning from paradigm cases

### Methodologies

- **Reflective Equilibrium**: Iteratively adjusting principles and case judgments
- **Veil of Ignorance**: Ensuring impartiality by bracketing self-interest
- **Universalizability Test**: Consistency across similar cases
- **Trolley Problem Variations**: Probing intuitions about harm and agency

## Quick Start

### Basic Usage

```
Claude, use the ethicist-analyst skill to analyze [ETHICAL ISSUE].

Examples:
- "Use ethicist-analyst to evaluate the ethics of facial recognition surveillance."
- "Analyze the whistleblowing dilemma using ethicist-analyst skill."
- "Use ethicist skill to assess fairness of this resource allocation policy."
```

### Advanced Usage

Specify particular frameworks or considerations:

```
"Use ethicist-analyst to analyze autonomous vehicle crash algorithms, applying both
deontological and consequentialist frameworks."

"Apply ethicist-analyst with stakeholder analysis and justice perspective to evaluate
this healthcare rationing proposal."

"Use ethicist-analyst to examine genetic enhancement from virtue ethics and care
ethics perspectives."
```

## Analysis Process

The ethicist analyst follows a systematic 10-step process:

1. **Clarify Ethical Issue** - Define moral question, distinguish from non-ethical concerns
2. **Gather Facts** - Verify empirical claims, identify realistic alternatives
3. **Identify Stakeholders** - List all affected parties, including vulnerable and voiceless
4. **Articulate Value Conflicts** - What principles, rights, or goods are in tension?
5. **Apply Frameworks** - Use deontological, consequentialist, virtue, care, justice lenses
6. **Test Consistency** - Would same reasoning apply in relevantly similar cases?
7. **Consider Alternatives** - Engage counterarguments and diverse perspectives
8. **Assess Constraints** - Note legal, political, resource limitations
9. **Reach Equilibrium** - Construct coherent justification for conclusion
10. **Communicate Transparently** - Present reasoning, acknowledge trade-offs and limitations

## Example Analyses

### Example 1: Autonomous Vehicle Crash Algorithm

**Dilemma**: Should self-driving cars prioritize passenger safety or minimize total casualties?

**Analysis Highlights**:

- **Deontology**: Cannot use passenger as mere means; violates Kantian respect for persons
- **Consequentialism**: Minimize total harm; utilitarian algorithm saves more lives overall
- **Virtue Ethics**: Depends on context; practical wisdom needed for case-by-case judgment
- **Rights**: Passengers have contractual expectations; pedestrians have right to life
- **Recommendation**: Transparency paramount; default to minimize harm with exceptions for vulnerable persons

### Example 2: Genetic Enhancement of Children

**Dilemma**: Should parents be permitted to genetically enhance children's intelligence, athleticism, appearance?

**Analysis Highlights**:

- **Autonomy**: Child cannot consent to irrevocable changes
- **Justice**: Only wealthy afford enhancement, creating "genetic divide"
- **Virtue**: Unconditional parental love vs. treating children as products to design
- **Harm Principle**: Enhancement creates social pressure, inequality, compromises child autonomy
- **Recommendation**: Permit therapy (disease prevention) but prohibit enhancement; international cooperation to prevent genetic tourism

### Example 3: Healthcare Whistleblowing

**Dilemma**: Nurse discovers hospital under-reports safety incidents. Whistleblow despite career risk?

**Analysis Highlights**:

- **Professional Duty**: Patient safety is primary obligation in nursing ethics
- **Deontology**: Cannot use patients as means to institutional reputation goals
- **Consequentialism**: Weigh patient harm prevented vs. personal career cost
- **Care Ethics**: Vulnerability of patients creates special obligations
- **Recommendation**: Whistleblow to regulator after exhausting internal channels; use anonymous reporting to protect career while enabling reform

## Common Questions

### When should I use ethicist-analyst vs. other analysts?

Use **ethicist-analyst** when the question involves:

- Moral rights, duties, and obligations
- Value conflicts and ethical dilemmas
- Fairness, justice, and equity
- What ought to be done (normative questions)
- Professional ethics and codes of conduct
- Technology governance and responsible innovation

Use **other analysts** when the focus is:

- Legal requirements and compliance → Lawyer
- Disease patterns and health outcomes → Epidemiologist
- Social norms and cultural practices → Sociologist/Anthropologist
- Economic efficiency and incentives → Economist
- Political power and institutions → Political Scientist

### How does ethics differ from law?

**Ethics**:

- What is morally right/wrong
- Broader than law (many unethical acts are legal)
- Guides what law should be
- Personal and professional domains

**Law**:

- What is legally permitted/prohibited
- Minimum standards enforceable by state
- Sometimes lags behind ethical consensus
- Public and regulatory domains

Many issues have both ethical and legal dimensions that must be analyzed separately.

### What if ethical frameworks disagree?

This is common and reveals genuine value conflicts:

1. **Acknowledge disagreement** rather than forcing false consensus
2. **Identify which values are in tension** (e.g., liberty vs. equality, individual vs. collective)
3. **Assess which framework fits the case** (deontology for rights violations, consequentialism for policy)
4. **Seek reflective equilibrium** adjusting principles and judgments
5. **Make trade-offs explicit** in final recommendation
6. **Accept reasonable pluralism** on some issues

### Can ethics be objective or is it all subjective?

Ethics involves both objective and subjective elements:

- **Objective**: Logic, consistency, factual accuracy, rational justification required
- **Subjective**: Ultimate values may differ (liberty vs. equality emphasis)
- **Intersubjective**: Wide agreement possible through reasoning and shared humanity
- Better: Some positions are better justified than others, even if perfect consensus impossible

### How do you balance speed and depth in ethical analysis?

Context determines appropriate depth:

- **Crisis decisions**: Focus on immediate harms, rights violations; act quickly with best available reasoning
- **Policy design**: Comprehensive multi-framework analysis; time for deliberation and consultation
- **Routine professional ethics**: Use established guidelines and paradigm cases
- **Novel issues**: Deep philosophical analysis; no shortcuts for unprecedented questions
