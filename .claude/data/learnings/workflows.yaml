  # Real example: Git worktree workflow
  - id: "wf-001"
    created: "2025-11-25T00:00:00Z"
    keywords:
      - "git"
      - "worktree"
      - "parallel"
      - "branch"
      - "development"
    summary: "Use git worktrees for parallel feature development instead of branch switching"
    insight: |
      Git worktrees allow working on multiple branches simultaneously without
      stashing or committing incomplete work. Each worktree is a separate
      directory with its own checkout. This is especially useful when:
      - Reviewing PRs while working on your own feature
      - Running long tests on one branch while coding on another
      - Comparing implementations across branches

      Worktrees share the same .git, so pushes/pulls work from any worktree.
    example: |
      # Create worktree for a feature branch
      git worktree add ../worktrees/feat/my-feature -b feat/my-feature

      # List all worktrees
      git worktree list

      # Remove worktree when done
      git worktree remove ../worktrees/feat/my-feature

  # Real example: Pre-commit verification workflow
  - id: "wf-002"
    created: "2025-11-25T00:00:00Z"
    keywords:
      - "pre-commit"
      - "ci"
      - "lint"
      - "format"
      - "commit"
    summary: "Always run pre-commit before pushing to catch CI failures locally"
    insight: |
      Running pre-commit locally before pushing catches 80% of CI failures.
      This saves the 5-10 minute round-trip of push -> CI fail -> fix -> push.

      Make it a habit:
      1. Run `pre-commit run --all-files` before final commit
      2. Use `pre-commit install` to auto-run on every commit
      3. When CI fails, first run pre-commit locally to reproduce
    example: |
      # Run on all files before pushing
      pre-commit run --all-files

      # Auto-install for all commits
      pre-commit install

      # Run specific hooks only
      pre-commit run ruff --all-files
