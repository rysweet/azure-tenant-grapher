  # Real example: Isolating import issues

    keywords:
      - "import"
      - "debug"
      - "isolate"
      - "python"
      - "module"
    summary: "Use 'python -c' to isolate import errors from other code"
    insight: |
      When imports fail mysteriously (especially in larger codebases),
      isolate the problem by testing imports in a fresh Python process:

      `python -c "import module_name"`

      This removes interference from other imports, cached modules, or
      runtime state. The error message will be cleaner and point directly
      to the actual problem.
    example: |
      # Test a single import in isolation
      python -c "import problematic_module"

      # Test a specific submodule
      python -c "from package.submodule import function"

      # Check the import path
      python -c "import sys; print(sys.path)"

  # Real example: Hook debugging strategy
  - id: "dbg-002"
    created: "2025-11-25T00:00:00Z"
    keywords:
      - "hook"
      - "claude"
      - "debug"
      - "log"
      - "session"
    summary: "Debug Claude Code hooks by checking runtime logs first"
    insight: |
      When hooks don't behave as expected:
      1. Check .claude/runtime/logs/ for session-specific logs
      2. Look for hook execution timestamps and outputs
      3. Verify hook is registered in settings.json
      4. Test hook function independently before integration

      Hooks fail silently by design (to not break sessions), so logging
      is the primary debugging mechanism.
    example: |
      # Check recent session logs
      ls -lt .claude/runtime/logs/ | head -5

      # View specific session log
      cat .claude/runtime/logs/2025-11-25_123456/hook_output.log

      # Test hook function directly
      python -c "from hook_module import stop_hook; stop_hook(session_data)"
