# Example mapping demonstrating the structure
# This is sample data - real mappings are built by analyzing imports
mappings:

# Instructions:
# 1. Run "Build test mapping for this project" to populate with real data
# 2. Smart-test skill analyzes Python imports to build mappings
# 3. Cache expires after cache_valid_days (rebuild when stale)
# 4. Mappings enable tiered test selection for faster feedback
