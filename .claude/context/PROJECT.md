# Project: Microsoft Hackathon 2025 - Agentic Coding Framework

## Overview

This project is developing an advanced agentic coding framework that leverages AI agents to accelerate software development through intelligent automation, code generation, and collaborative problem-solving.

## Mission

Create a development environment where AI agents work alongside developers as true partners, handling complex coding tasks autonomously while maintaining high code quality and architectural integrity.

## Core Objectives

### 1. Agent-Powered Development

- **Specialized Agents**: Deploy task-specific agents for different development needs
- **Parallel Execution**: Run multiple agents simultaneously for faster development
- **Intelligent Delegation**: Automatically route tasks to the most appropriate agent
- **Context Preservation**: Maintain project context across agent interactions

### 2. Self-Improving System

- **Learning from Experience**: Capture and apply lessons from each development session
- **Pattern Recognition**: Identify and codify recurring solutions
- **Performance Optimization**: Continuously improve agent effectiveness
- **Knowledge Synthesis**: Build a growing knowledge base from project activities

### 3. Modular Architecture

- **Brick Philosophy**: Build self-contained, regeneratable modules
- **Clear Contracts**: Define explicit interfaces between components
- **AI-Ready Design**: Structure code for easy AI comprehension and modification
- **Parallel Development**: Support multiple implementation variants

## Key Features

### Agent Ecosystem

- **Core Agents**: Architect, Builder, Reviewer for fundamental tasks
- **Specialized Agents**: Database, Security, Integration for domain expertise
- **Meta Agents**: Agents that create and improve other agents
- **Custom Agents**: Project-specific agents for unique requirements

### Development Workflows

- **Ultra-Thinking**: Deep analysis mode for complex problems
- **Code Analysis**: Comprehensive review and improvement suggestions
- **Automated Testing**: AI-driven test generation and validation
- **Documentation**: Auto-generated and maintained documentation

### Intelligence Features

- **Context Awareness**: Understands project structure and patterns
- **Memory System**: Persistent learning across sessions
- **Metric Tracking**: Monitors performance and improvement
- **Self-Diagnostics**: Identifies and addresses its own limitations
