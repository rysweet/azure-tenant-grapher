### vm-dev-68e3c672 (Microsoft.Compute/virtualMachines)

> DC01 is a domain-controller virtual machine (type Microsoft.Compute/virtualMachines) deployed in the East US region to provide Active Directory, DNS, and time-services for the workload VNET. It is built from the Marketplace image “MicrosoftWindowsServer:WindowsServer:2022-datacenter-azure-edition:latest”, sized Standard_D2s_v3 (2 vCPU, 8 GiB RAM) with a 128-GiB Premium SSD managed OS disk encrypted with Azure Storage Service Encryption and a 512 GiB Premium SSD data disk for the SYSVOL/NTDS database. The VM’s NIC (static private IP 10.10.1.4/24) is attached to subnet “ad-subnet” of VNET “core-vnet” and protected by an NSG that allows inbound RDP (TCP 3389) only from the corporate jump-host IP range (203.0.113.10/32) and blocks all public ingress—no public IP is assigned. Deployment depends on the virtual network, subnet, network interface, NSG, managed disks, and an optional Key Vault disk-encryption set; AD-aware resources (file servers, application servers) must point DNS to this VM. It is created in resource group “rg-infra-eastus”; engineers should enable Azure Backup (daily, 30-day retention), VM guest-level monitoring via Log Analytics workspace “log-infra”, and assign the built-in “Virtual Machine Contributor” role to the automation identity that performs domain-join extensions during provisioning.
