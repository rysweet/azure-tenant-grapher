# Implementation Summary: Parallel Property Fetching for Azure Resources

## Overview
Successfully implemented parallel property fetching to resolve missing resource properties in tenant specifications. When `atg build` is run, it now fetches complete resource details including vmSize, osProfile, storageProfile, and other configuration properties.

## Pull Request
**PR #141**: https://github.com/rysweet/azure-tenant-grapher/pull/141

## Key Changes

### 1. Two-Phase Resource Discovery
- **Phase 1**: List all resources (lightweight, fast)
- **Phase 2**: Fetch full properties in parallel using `get_by_id()`

### 2. Dynamic API Version Resolution
- Queries resource providers for correct API versions
- Caches API versions for performance
- Falls back to safe defaults when needed

### 3. Parallel Fetching with Concurrency Control
- New `--max-build-threads` CLI parameter (default: 20)
- Semaphore-based concurrency control
- Batch processing (100 resources per batch) for memory management

### 4. Property Preservation (Critical Fix)
- Prevents empty properties {} from overwriting existing data
- Only updates properties when non-empty values are available
- Preserves expensive LLM-generated descriptions during re-runs

## Files Modified

### Core Implementation
- `src/services/azure_discovery_service.py`: Added parallel fetching logic
- `src/resource_processor.py`: Added property preservation logic
- `src/config_manager.py`: Added max_build_threads configuration
- `scripts/cli.py`: Added --max-build-threads parameter
- `src/cli_commands.py`: Updated build command signature

### Tests
- `tests/test_azure_discovery_parallel.py`: Comprehensive parallel fetching tests
- `tests/test_property_preservation.py`: Property preservation tests
- `tests/test_properties_extraction.py`: Updated extraction tests

## How It Works

### Before (Problem)
```python
# Azure SDK list() returns minimal objects
resource = client.resources.list()
# resource.properties is always None or empty
```

### After (Solution)
```python
# Phase 1: Get resource IDs
resources = client.resources.list()

# Phase 2: Fetch full details in parallel
async def fetch_with_properties(resource):
    api_version = get_api_version(resource.type)
    full = client.resources.get_by_id(resource.id, api_version)
    return full.properties.as_dict()
```

## Database Update Behavior

When `atg build` is re-run:
1. **Resources are UPDATED**, not duplicated (uses Neo4j MERGE)
2. **Properties are preserved** if fetch fails
3. **Timestamps track** when resources were last updated

## Usage Examples

### Full property fetching (default)
```bash
atg build  # Uses 20 threads by default
```

### Custom concurrency
```bash
atg build --max-build-threads 10  # Limit to 10 concurrent API calls
```

### Disable parallel fetching
```bash
atg build --max-build-threads 0  # Sequential processing only
```

## Performance Impact

- **Initial discovery**: ~Same speed (list operation unchanged)
- **Property fetching**: Significantly faster with parallelization
- **Memory usage**: Controlled through batching
- **API rate limits**: Respected through Azure SDK retry logic

## Testing

### Unit Tests
- ✅ API version resolution
- ✅ Parallel fetching with semaphore
- ✅ Error handling and retry logic
- ✅ Property preservation
- ✅ Batch processing

### CI Status
- All tests passing
- Pre-commit checks passing
- Security checks passing

## Known Limitations

1. **API rate limits**: May hit Azure API limits with high concurrency
2. **Memory usage**: Large properties (>5000 chars) are truncated
3. **API versions**: Some resource types may need manual version mapping

## Next Steps

1. Monitor production usage for performance
2. Consider adding property diff detection
3. Implement incremental updates for large tenants
4. Add metrics for parallel fetching performance

## Conclusion

The implementation successfully resolves the missing properties issue while:
- Maintaining backward compatibility
- Preventing data loss on re-runs
- Providing configurable performance tuning
- Following Azure SDK best practices

The solution is production-ready and has been thoroughly tested.
