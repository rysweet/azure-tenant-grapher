# Property Validation Coverage Thresholds
#
# These thresholds enforce quality gates for IaC property coverage.
# CI/CD will fail if any threshold is violated.

thresholds:
  # Overall minimum coverage across all handlers (percentage)
  overall_minimum: 70

  # Per-handler minimum coverage (percentage)
  # Each handler must meet this threshold independently
  per_handler_minimum: 60

  # Maximum allowed CRITICAL gaps (should be 0)
  # CRITICAL gaps block deployment and have no defaults
  critical_gaps_allowed: 0

  # Maximum allowed HIGH priority gaps
  # HIGH gaps represent security/compliance issues
  high_gaps_allowed: 2

  # Regression tolerance (percentage points)
  # Negative value means coverage must not decrease by more than this amount
  # -5 means coverage can drop by at most 5 percentage points
  regression_tolerance: -5

# Documentation:
# - overall_minimum: Fail if average coverage across all handlers < this value
# - per_handler_minimum: Fail if any single handler coverage < this value
# - critical_gaps_allowed: Fail if any CRITICAL gaps exist (typically 0)
# - high_gaps_allowed: Fail if HIGH priority gaps exceed this count
# - regression_tolerance: Fail if coverage decreased by more than this amount
#
# Adjust these values based on your project's maturity and risk tolerance.
