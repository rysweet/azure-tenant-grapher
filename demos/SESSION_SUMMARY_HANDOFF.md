   - Shows iteration, fidelity, successes
   - Checks if loops are running

## The Critical Insight

### Problem Identified

Over the past 10+ hours of local execution, multiple attempts failed due to **session persistence**:

1. Agent spawned background processes (terraform, monitors, etc.)
2. Agent completed tasks and session ended
3. All background processes were killed
4. Work stopped, no progress made
5. Cycle repeated multiple times

### Solution Implemented

The cloud agent must:

1. **Start autonomous loop** (runs forever until objective)
2. **Enter infinite monitoring loop** (keeps session alive)
3. **Never exit** until objective fully achieved
4. **Handle all work in spawned processes** while maintaining active session

The key pattern:
```python
while not objective_achieved():
    monitor_status()
    handle_issues()
    spawn_fixes_if_needed()
    time.sleep(60)  # Keep session alive
```

## Current State Summary

### Repository
- Location: `/Users/ryan/src/msec/atg-0723/azure-tenant-grapher`
- Branch: `main`
- Recent commits: DCR case sensitivity fix, VM extension validation, VNet addressSpace

### Data
- Neo4j: 991 nodes, 1876 edges (per SPA)
- Source tenant: 410 resources (DefenderATEVET17)
- Target tenant: 158 resources (DefenderATEVET12)
- Current fidelity: 38.5%

### Iterations
- Latest: iteration207
- Total generated: 207+ iterations
- Location: `demos/iteration{N}/`
- Some deployed partially (97% success rate on iteration 206)

### Issues
- Fixed: VNet truncation, VM extensions, DCR case, DevTestLab schedules
- Open: Deployment timeout, permission errors (needs investigation)
- Pattern: Most iterations validate successfully after recent fixes

## What the Cloud Agent Should Do

### Immediate (First 10 Minutes)
1. Read START_HERE.md
2. Read QUICK_START_CLOUD.md
3. Verify environment (Neo4j, Azure, repo)
4. Launch autonomous loop
5. Launch monitor
6. Enter infinite monitoring loop

### First Hour
1. Watch first iteration complete
2. Check for errors
3. Spawn fix agents if needed
4. Send first status update

### First 4-8 Hours
1. Monitor multiple iterations
2. Identify recurring patterns
3. Fix root causes in parallel
4. Track fidelity improvements

### Until Objective (12-24 hours)
1. Continue monitoring
2. Keep session alive
3. Watch fidelity approach 95%
4. Verify 3 consecutive successes
5. **Only then** exit and report success

---

## Expected Outcomes

### Success Scenario (Expected)
- Iterations run continuously
- Fidelity increases steadily
- Reaches 95% after ~12-16 hours
- Gets 3 consecutive successes
- Objective achieved
- Agent exits with success report

### Partial Success Scenario (Possible)
- Control plane reaches 80-90%
- Some resources consistently fail
- Need additional emitter mappings
- Entra ID phase begins
- Work continues

### Failure Scenario (Unlikely)
- Major infrastructure issue
- Credentials expire
- Neo4j crashes
- Requires human intervention

---

## Key Metrics to Track

### Fidelity
- Current: 38.5% (158/410)
- Target: 95% (389/410)
- Gap: 231 resources

### Iteration Success
- Current: Unknown consecutive successes
- Target: 3 consecutive
- Tracked in: `demos/autonomous_state.json`

### Time
- Estimated: 12-24 hours
- Per iteration: ~60-90 minutes
- Total iterations needed: ~10-15

---

## Communication Plan

### iMessage Notifications
Send at:
- Loop start
- Each iteration complete
- Fidelity milestones (50%, 75%, 90%, 95%)
- Errors requiring attention
- Objective achieved

### Status Files
Update continuously:
- `demos/autonomous_state.json` - Loop state
- `demos/autonomous_loop.log` - Detailed log
- `demos/continuous_engine_status.json` - Metrics

## Final Notes

This handoff represents a complete transfer of context, tools, and procedures from the local development sessions to a cloud-based autonomous agent.

The key insight learned over 10+ hours of local attempts is simple but critical: **The agent session must stay alive until the work is complete.**

All the tools are built. All the patterns are established. All the documentation is written.

Now it's time to execute.
