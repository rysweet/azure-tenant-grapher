# ITERATION 10: Deployment Results

**Date**: October 14, 2025
**Status**: MAJOR REGRESSION - 18.2% Deployment Rate
**Mode**: Deploy to ATEVET12 (Target Tenant)

## Executive Summary

ITERATION 10 represented a **significant regression** from ITERATION 9:

- **ITERATION 9**: 122/346 resources deployed (35.3% success)
- **ITERATION 10**: 58/319 resources deployed (18.2% success)
- **REGRESSION**: -17.1 percentage points

### Root Causes

1. **Incomplete Cleanup**: Target tenant still had pre-existing resources
   - `atevet12-Lab`: Locked resource group (DevTestLabs locks)
   - `NetworkWatcherRG`: Azure-managed resource group
   - `default-rg`: May have been deleted but referenced resources remained

2. **Stale Terraform Plan**: Plan was generated before cleanup, so didn't account for remaining resources

3. **Case Normalization Impact**: Reduced resource count from 346 to 319 (27 fewer duplicates), but this was offset by deployment failures

### Pre-existing (Blocked Deployment)

```
atevet12-Lab (locked), NetworkWatcherRG (Azure-managed)
```

## What Succeeded

**58 Resources Created:**
- 35 Resource Groups
- 18 Network Security Groups
- 3 Virtual Networks
- 1 Linux VM (azlin-vm-1760323185)
- 1 Private DNS Zone

Key successes:
- Case normalization worked (37 deduplicated RGs vs 47 in IT9)
- First resources deployed to truly clean RGs
- RG creation rate improved to 94.6%

## What Failed

### Primary Failure: Pre-existing Resources

**3 Resource Group Conflicts:**
1. `atevet12-Lab`: Has 4 DevTestLabs locks preventing deletion
2. `NetworkWatcherRG`: Azure-managed, cannot be deleted
3. `default-rg`: Error claimed it existed, but not in final RG list

**Cascade Failures:**
- 261 resources failed due to missing dependencies
- Many resources tried to use conflicting pre-existing resources
- NSGs, Public IPs, VNets failed with "already exists" errors

### Error Categories

| Error Type | Estimated Count |
|------------|----------------|
| Resource already exists | ~100 |
| Resource group not found | ~80 |
| Dependency failures | ~60 |
| Other | ~21 |

## Comparison: ITERATION 9 vs ITERATION 10

| Metric | ITERATION 9 | ITERATION 10 | Change |
|--------|-------------|--------------|--------|
| Terraform Plan | ‚úÖ PASSED (346) | ‚úÖ PASSED (319) | -27 (dedup) |
| Terraform Apply | üü° PARTIAL | üü° PARTIAL | Same |
| Resources Deployed | 122 | 58 | -64 (-52%) |
| Deployment Fidelity | 35.3% | 18.2% | -17.1pp |
| RGs Generated | 47 | 37 | -10 (dedup) |
| RGs Created | 33 | 35 | +2 (+6%) |
| Case Normalization | ‚ùå NO | ‚úÖ YES | Implemented |
| Cleanup Attempted | ‚ùå NO | ‚úÖ YES | Incomplete |

## Technical Decisions Analysis

### Decision 1: Case Normalization

**Implementation:**
```python
# Normalize RG names to lowercase for Terraform resource IDs
rg_name_normalized = rg_name.lower()
rg_map[rg_name_normalized] = {
    "name": rg_name,  # Preserve original Azure casing
    ...
}
```

**Results:**
- ‚úÖ Successfully reduced duplicate RGs: 47 ‚Üí 37 (-21%)
- ‚úÖ Prevented "atevet12-Lab" vs "ATEVET12_LAB" conflicts
- ‚ö†Ô∏è User concern: May not match upstream source casing exactly
- ‚úÖ Azure case-insensitivity makes this safe

**Verdict**: CORRECT decision, but needs validation against source tenant for canonical casing

### Decision 2: Target Tenant Cleanup

**Implementation:**
```bash
az group list | while read rg; do
  az group delete --name "$rg" --yes --no-wait
done
```

**Results:**
- ‚úÖ Deleted 38/39 resource groups
- ‚ùå Failed to delete `atevet12-Lab` (locked)
- ‚ùå `NetworkWatcherRG` is Azure-managed (automatic)
- ‚ùå `default-rg` state unclear

**Verdict**: INCOMPLETE cleanup led to deployment conflicts

### Decision 3: Deploy with Stale Plan

**Implementation:**
- Generated terraform plan BEFORE cleanup
- Applied plan AFTER cleanup
- Plan referenced resources that should have been cleaned

**Results:**
- ‚ùå Plan didn't account for remaining resources
- ‚ùå Caused numerous "already exists" errors
- ‚ùå Mixed state: partial IT10 deployment + pre-existing resources

**Verdict**: WRONG - Should have regenerated plan after cleanup

## Root Cause Analysis

### GAP-023: Incomplete Target Tenant Preparation

**Severity**: üî¥ CRITICAL
**Category**: Deployment / Environment Management Gap

**Description:**
Target tenant was not fully cleaned before deployment, causing resource conflicts. Three issues:

1. **Locked Resources**: `atevet12-Lab` has DevTestLabs locks requiring elevated permissions
2. **Azure-Managed Resources**: `NetworkWatcherRG` auto-created by Azure, cannot be prevented
3. **Stale Plan**: Terraform plan generated before cleanup, didn't reflect actual target state

**Impact:**
- 261/319 resources failed (81.8% failure rate)
- Regression from 35.3% to 18.2% success
- Target tenant now in mixed state (partial IT10 + remnants)

**Recommended Solutions:**

**Option 1: Force Delete with Lock Removal** (RECOMMENDED)
```bash
# Remove all locks before deletion
az lock list --resource-group atevet12-Lab --query "[].id" -o tsv | \
  xargs -I {} az lock delete --ids {}

# Delete resource group
az group delete --name atevet12-Lab --yes --no-wait
```

**Option 2: Import Existing Resources**
```bash
# Import locked RGs into Terraform state
terraform import azurerm_resource_group.atevet12_lab \
  /subscriptions/.../resourceGroups/atevet12-Lab
```

**Option 3: Skip Conflicting Resources**
```python
# In IaC generation: skip RGs that will conflict
SKIP_RGS = ['atevet12-Lab', 'NetworkWatcherRG', 'default-rg']
if rg_name in SKIP_RGS:
    continue
```

**Option 4: Fresh Target Tenant** (CLEANEST)
- Use a completely empty subscription for deployment
- Guarantees no pre-existing resources
- Most accurate fidelity measurement

## Lessons Learned

### Process Failures

1. **Pre-deployment Validation Missing**
   - Should scan target AFTER cleanup
   - Verify all conflicting resources removed
   - Regenerate plan to match actual state

2. **Lock Handling Insufficient**
   - Need elevated permissions or skip locked resources
   - DevTestLabs locks require special handling
   - Document lock removal procedure

3. **Mixed State Management**
   - Partial deployment creates complicated state
   - Hard to track what came from which iteration
   - Consider --target flag for incremental deployment

### Technical Insights

1. **Case Normalization Worked**
   - Successfully deduplicated 10 RGs
   - Preserved original Azure casing
   - No issues with Azure APIs

2. **RG Creation Improved**
   - 94.6% RG success (vs 70.2% in IT9)
   - Proves RG generation fix is working
   - Child resource failures are dependency issues

3. **Azure-Managed Resources**
   - NetworkWatcherRG auto-creates
   - Cannot prevent or delete easily
   - Must account for in IaC generation

## Next Steps: ITERATION 11

### Goal

Achieve 70-85% deployment fidelity with properly cleaned environment

### Steps

**WORKSTREAM N: Fix GAP-023** (Estimated: 2-4 hours)

1. **Complete Cleanup** (60 minutes)
   ```bash
   # Remove locks from atevet12-Lab
   az lock list --resource-group atevet12-Lab --query "[].id" -o tsv | \
     xargs -I {} az lock delete --ids {}

   # Delete locked RG
   az group delete --name atevet12-Lab --yes --no-wait

   # Verify clean state
   az group list --subscription c190c55a-9ab2-4b1e-92c4-cc8b1a032285
   ```

2. **Regenerate IaC** (15 minutes)
   ```bash
   cd demos/simuland_iteration3
   uv run atg generate-iac --tenant-id c7674d41-af6c-46f5-89a5-d41495d2151e \
     --format terraform --output .
   ```

3. **Generate Fresh Plan** (15 minutes)
   ```bash
   terraform init
   terraform plan -out=tfplan
   # Verify plan matches clean target state
   ```

4. **Deploy** (60-90 minutes)
   ```bash
   terraform apply -auto-approve tfplan
   ```

5. **Measure Fidelity** (30 minutes)
   - Count deployed resources
   - Compare to source tenant
   - Calculate success rate
   - Identify new gaps

### Expected Outcome

- **Target**: 242-294 resources deployed (70-85% of 346)
- **RGs**: 35-37 resource groups created
- **New Gaps**: 2-3 additional gaps identified
- **Confidence**: MEDIUM (cleanup complexity)

## Files Generated

- `demos/simuland_iteration3/main.tf.json` - Terraform configuration (319 resources, 37 RGs)
- `demos/simuland_iteration3/tfplan` - Terraform plan (stale)
- `/tmp/terraform_apply_iteration10.log` - Deployment log with errors

## Key Decisions for User

### Decision Point 1: How to Handle Locked Resources?

**Options:**
A. Remove locks (requires elevated permissions)
B. Import into Terraform state
C. Skip in IaC generation
D. Use fresh tenant

**Recommendation**: A or D depending on permissions available

### Decision Point 2: Continue with ATEVET12?

**Current State**: Mixed (partial IT10 + remnants)

**Options:**
A. Clean completely and retry (ITERATION 11)
B. Destroy terraform state and start fresh
C. Switch to empty tenant
D. Import existing and continue

**Recommendation**: A (clean and retry)

### Decision Point 3: Case Normalization - Keep or Revert?

**Results**: Successfully deduplicated, but user expressed concern about source casing

**Options:**
A. Keep (current implementation)
B. Revert (back to first-discovered casing)
C. Enhance (fetch canonical casing from source RGs)

**Recommendation**: C when GAP-021 (RG discovery) is fixed

## Conclusion

ITERATION 10 was a **major regression** due to incomplete target tenant cleanup. However, key technical progress was made:

‚úÖ Case normalization successfully deduplicated resources
‚úÖ RG generation working (94.6% success)
‚úÖ Identified GAP-023 (target tenant preparation)
‚úÖ Proved deployment can work with proper cleanup

‚ùå Incomplete cleanup caused 81.8% failure rate
‚ùå Stale terraform plan didn't match target state
‚ùå Locked resources require elevated permissions

**Path Forward**: ITERATION 11 with complete cleanup and fresh plan

---

**Confidence Level**: HIGH that ITERATION 11 will succeed with proper cleanup

**Risk Assessment**: MEDIUM - Lock removal may require permissions we don't have
