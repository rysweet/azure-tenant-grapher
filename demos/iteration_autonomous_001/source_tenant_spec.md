### üìÅ Subscription: subscription-1377

**Purpose:** Multi-Region Deployment

- **Regions:** 9
- **Resources:** 267

#### üåç Region: northcentralus

- **Resource Groups:** 2
- **Resources:** 24

##### üì¶ Resource Group: rg-3686

**Purpose:** Web Application Resources

- **Resource Count:** 23

###### Resources:

**Microsoft.Automation/automationAccounts** (1 items)

- **res-azure-31441357**
  > Azure Automation Account named "aa160224hpcp4rein6" is deployed in the "northcentralus" region and configured with the "Basic" SKU to facilitate automation of cloud tasks such as runbooks, update management, and operational workloads. The account enforces private network connectivity by disabling public network access (publicNetworkAccess: false) and integrating with a specified private endpoint (id: [ANONYMIZED][ANONYMIZED]/providers/Microsoft.Network/privateEndpoints/aa160224hpcp4rein6-automation-private-endpoint), ensuring secure, internal-only access for webhook traffic. The Automation Account uses built-in Az PowerShell modules (versions 11.2.0 for PowerShell and PowerShell 7.2 runtimes, 8.0.0 for PowerShell 7), supporting management scenarios across resource types; encryption is managed by Microsoft.Automation with no user-assigned identity specified. It is deployed within the "ARTBAS-160224hpcp4rein6" resource group and leverages an auto-approved private endpoint connection for critical network isolation and compliance. Important deployment considerations include ensuring that the associated private endpoint exists and is properly linked, and that client workloads accessing the account can route traffic via the private link (Webhook groupId), supporting secure automation operations in a compliant environment.
  - Properties:
    - publicNetworkAccess: False
    - disableLocalAuth: False
    - sku: {'name': 'Basic', 'family': None, 'capacity': None}
    - state: Ok
    - RegistrationUrl: https://[ANONYMIZED].agentsvc.ncus.azure-automation.net/accounts/[ANONYMIZED]

**Microsoft.EventHub/namespaces** (1 items)

- **res-azure-34c8cce9**
  > Azure Event Hubs namespace "evh160224hpcp4rein6" is provisioned in the North Central US region to serve as a scalable, real-time event ingestion platform for streaming data, with integrated Kafka protocol support for broad compatibility. The namespace is created with default SKU settings (no explicit SKU specified), public network access enabled, and Kafka compatibility turned on (kafkaEnabled: true), making it accessible for both Event Hubs clients and Kafka producers/consumers. Security configurations include minimum TLS version 1.0, local authentication enabled (disableLocalAuth: false), confidential compute explicitly disabled, and zone redundancy turned off, indicating no cross-availability zone fault tolerance. This resource does not leverage throughput autoscaling (isAutoInflateEnabled: false) or geo-replication, and is tagged for traceability with campaign-specific and deployment metadata. Deployment depends on an active Azure resource group and requires appropriate role assignments for Event Hubs management; additional configuration (such as SKUs or private endpoints) may be needed for enhanced availability or security based on workload requirements.
  - Properties:
    - platformCapabilities: {'confidentialCompute': {'mode': 'Disabled'}}
    - errors: []

**Microsoft.KeyVault/vaults** (1 items)

- **res-this-c611d29c**
  > This resource is an Azure Key Vault named **simKV160224hpcp4rein6** deployed in the **northcentralus** region, designed to securely manage cryptographic keys, secrets, and certificates for applications within the corresponding resource group (**ARTBAS-160224hpcp4rein6**). It is configured with the **Standard SKU (family: A)** and utilizes Azure RBAC for access control (**enableRbacAuthorization: true**), with all legacy access policies removed, ensuring integration with modern Azure security practices. Network access is strictly private (**publicNetworkAccess: Disabled**) and enforced through a dedicated private endpoint (**simKV160224hpcp4rein6-keyvault-private-endpoint**), with no access via public IPs‚Äîsupporting secure, internal-only connectivity. To safeguard against accidental deletion, soft delete is enabled with a retention period of **90 days** (**[ANONYMIZED]s: 90**), providing compliance with data protection standards. The Key Vault is not integrated with ARM, VM, or disk encryption deployments (**enabledForDeployment/TemplateDeployment/DiskEncryption: false**); special deployment metadata is captured via resource tags for traceability, and the resource relies on the specified tenant (**tenantId: [ANONYMIZED]**) and existing private networking infrastructure as critical dependencies.

  > This resource is a secure, general-purpose Azure Storage Account named **cm160224hpcp4rein6** deployed in the **northcentralus** region, serving as a central data repository for the **ARTBas CampaignManager** workload. It uses the **Hot** access tier for frequent data access and enforces security best practices by disabling public blob access (**allowBlobPublicAccess: false**), supporting only HTTPS traffic, and mandating a minimum TLS version of **1.2**. Data in both Blob and File services is encrypted at rest using Microsoft-managed keys, with automatic account-level encryption enabled. Network isolation is achieved through two private endpoint connections (one for Blob and one for File services) to dedicated Azure Private Endpoints, while network ACLs are set to allow Azure services and default to "Allow" for other access, though no custom rules are specified. The storage account is tagged for traceability (**Creator: ARTBAS**), is deployed within resource group **ARTBAS-160224hpcp4rein6**, and has essential dependencies on Azure Private Endpoint resources to restrict data access within the virtual network, supporting compliance and secure integration with internal applications.

This resource is a comprehensive Azure Cognitive Services account provisioned in the East US 2 region, designed to consolidate and deliver advanced AI workloads, including OpenAI, Vision, Speech, Form Recognizer, Text Analytics, Content Safety, and custom AI endpoints. The account is configured with a custom subdomain ("ai-adapt-oai-eastus2"), public network access enabled, and default network ACLs allowing unrestricted connectivity (no IP or VNet restrictions, `defaultAction=Allow`). Critical call rate limits and dynamic throttling settings are meticulously defined for individual service endpoints to ensure API usage compliance, performance consistency, and protection against abuse (for example, max 1000 calls per 60 seconds for Text Analytics endpoints and up to 100,000 calls per minute for OpenAI conversational APIs).

Key security and compliance features include support for Customer Managed Keys, Trusted Services integration (Microsoft.CognitiveServices, Microsoft.MachineLearningServices, Microsoft.Search), and ARM feature flags accepting relevant Responsible AI (RAI) legal terms. The account exposes numerous endpoints for each service (OpenAI, Vision, Speech, etc.), supports fine-tune jobs (max 500), model training with specified file limits, and associated project management (`defaultProject=ai-adapt-oai-eastus2-project`). The resource is not network-isolated (no private endpoints), but can be further integrated with Virtual Networks if required for compliance or protection.

Deployment requires placement in a resource group in East US 2, and consideration of dependencies such as associated projects and downstream endpoints configured to consume or manage Cognitive Services capabilities. Cloud engineers must ensure proper IAM/RBAC policies are in place to control access, and may need to connect storage and monitoring resources for model lifecycle and audit trails. This resource underpins scalable enterprise AI workloads while supporting advanced customization, security, and compliance control across multiple AI service domains.

  > Azure Key Vault "kv-adaptaie670410800455" is a centralized cloud service deployed in the East US 2 region designed to securely manage keys, secrets, and certificates for Azure applications within tenant ID [ANONYMIZED]. Configured with the Standard SKU (family "A"), the vault enables public network access and applies three granular access policies: each policy grants "all" permissions on keys, secrets, and certificates to specific Azure AD principals (object IDs [ANONYMIZED], [ANONYMIZED], and [ANONYMIZED]). For compliance and disaster recovery, soft delete is enabled, preventing immediate destruction of deleted data and supporting recovery scenarios; however, purge protection is not explicitly configured, which may be a consideration for stricter compliance requirements. The vault does not allow direct integration for VM deployment (enabledForDeployment: false), and does not currently employ advanced networking like private endpoints. Deployment requires that all referenced Azure AD object IDs exist in the designated tenant, and the resource must be placed in a resource group within eastus2, with optional tags for further organization.

  > This resource is an Azure Network Security Group (NSG) named **klakkaraju-abvm-nsg**, deployed in the **westus2** region and associated with the network interface **klakkaraju-abvm574_z1**. The NSG's primary role is to control inbound and outbound network traffic for virtual machines within the **sparta_attackbot** resource group, enforcing security boundaries at the network interface level. It features a custom inbound security rule permitting RDP (TCP port 3389) from any source, and an outbound rule allowing HTTPS traffic (port 443) to any destination, in addition to the standard default rules for virtual network, Azure load balancer access, and global deny-all policies for extra protection. There are no SKU or kind configurations required for NSGs, and dependencies include the relevant subnet or NIC that the NSG secures, as well as a correctly configured virtual network. Critical settings include the open RDP port, which may expose the VM to unauthorized access if not restricted, making it important to consider further IP whitelisting or enhanced authentication methods. To deploy this resource, specify **Microsoft.Network/networkSecurityGroups** in the ARM template or Terraform, set the location to **westus2**, target the correct resource group, and ensure you define both custom and default security rules as seen in the configuration.

  > This resource is a network security group (NSG) named andyye-windows11-vm-nsg deployed in the West US 2 region, designed to control inbound and outbound traffic to network interfaces or subnets associated with a Windows 11 VM. It allows inbound TCP traffic on port 3389 (RDP) from any source, facilitating remote desktop access; all other inbound connections are explicitly denied except traffic from the virtual network and Azure Load Balancer due to default rules. Outbound traffic is permitted to both the virtual network and the internet, with a final rule denying all other outbound connections, ensuring baseline network security and isolation. The NSG does not specify a SKU or custom tags and will depend on existing resources such as subnets or NICs within the sparta_attackbot resource group, to which it can be associated. For compliance and operational security, the NSG leverages standard Azure default security rules and should be carefully attached only to VMs needing RDP, with consideration given to limiting the RDP source range for enhanced protection.

  > This resource is a network security group (NSG) named **andyye-windows11-vm2-nsg** deployed in the **westus2** region, designed to control inbound and outbound network traffic for the associated network interface **andyye-windows11-vm2663_z1**, typically attached to a Windows 11 virtual machine. The NSG enforces a critical inbound security rule explicitly denying TCP traffic on port **3389** (RDP) from any source to any destination, enhancing the security posture by blocking direct RDP access from the internet (priority 300). In addition to the custom RDP rule, the NSG includes default security rules that allow traffic within the virtual network and from Azure load balancers, while denying all other inbound access (priority 65500), and permits outbound traffic to the virtual network and internet, except for a final "DenyAllOutBound" rule (priority 65500) that blocks all unspecified outbound flows. The NSG operates within the **sparta_attackbot** resource group, and its configuration is suitable for scenarios requiring strong access controls, regulatory compliance, and protection against unauthorized remote desktop protocol exposure. When recreating this resource, ensure the NSG is properly associated with the intended network interface, uses the same rule priorities, and is deployed to **westus2** for consistent connectivity and compliance requirements.

The NSG provides essential network layer protection for connected virtual machines by enforcing inbound and outbound traffic rules; in this configuration, only default Azure security rules are present, which permit intra-VNet traffic and Azure Load Balancer traffic (inbound), as well as outbound traffic to the Internet and the virtual network, while explicitly denying all other inbound and outbound connections. Critical settings include the absence of custom security rules, relying on the Azure defaults for baseline segmentation and isolation, which supports compliance and network hygiene for Windows-based workloads. The resource does not specify a SKU or tags, and while it can be extended with custom rules, its current configuration is suitable for general workloads requiring straightforward VNet and Internet communication with a strong default-deny posture. For deployment, ensure proper connectivity to the associated NIC and maintain resource group location consistency in **westus2** to avoid cross-region latency or compliance issues.

  > Network security group "dayan-vm-nsg" in the "westus2" region is deployed within the "sparta_attackbot" resource group to control inbound and outbound traffic to the attached network interface "dayan-vm566_z1". Architecturally, this NSG enforces the security posture by explicitly denying inbound RDP (TCP port 3389) from any source to any destination, thereby preventing direct internet-based remote desktop access and helping mitigate exposure risks flagged by compliance tools. Key configuration includes a custom inbound deny rule for RDP with priority 300, followed by default security rules permitting inbound traffic from Azure Virtual Network and Azure Load Balancer, and denying all other inbound connections; outbound defaults allow traffic to the Virtual Network and Internet but deny all other outbound flows for least-privilege enforcement. The NSG does not specify a SKU or tags and is currently associated with a single network interface, making it integral for VM-level network security. To recreate this resource, ensure deployment in "westus2" under the designated resource group, associate it with the target NIC, and implement both custom and default security rules as specified to maintain security and compliance requirements.

  > This resource is an Azure Virtual Network named **cseifert-windows-vm-vnet** provisioned in the **westus2** region within the **sparta_attackbot** resource group, providing a private, isolated network environment for Windows virtual machines and associated infrastructure. The virtual network uses the address space **10.0.0.0/16** and is segmented into two subnets: a **default** subnet (**10.0.0.0/24**) hosting multiple VM network interfaces, and a specialized **AzureBastionSubnet** (**10.0.1.0/26**) required to support Azure Bastion host connectivity for secure RDP/SSH access without exposing public IP addresses.

Key configurations include network policies with **private endpoint VNet policies disabled** at the VNet level, and both subnets have **private endpoint network policies disabled** and **private link service network policies enabled** to facilitate secure private connectivity and future integration with PaaS services. The network does **not** have DDOS protection enabled or any IP delegations configured, reflecting a standard security posture suitable for many internal workloads.

This VNet is directly dependent on multiple network interfaces (NICs) attached to Windows VMs and requires deployment of an Azure Bastion host in the **AzureBastionSubnet**. Critical to security and operational integrity, the subnets have explicitly set outbound access as **disabled**, restricting unapproved egress traffic. No custom SKU or resource tags are configured, and there are currently no configured peerings with other VNets, making this a standalone, project-scoped network foundation that can be reused or expanded for similar Windows workload environments.

  > This resource is a Network Security Group (NSG) named andyye-vm-nsg, deployed in the southcentralus region within the sparta_attackbot resource group, designed to secure network traffic to and from associated Azure Virtual Machines. The NSG contains a custom inbound security rule allowing SSH (TCP port 22) from any source, enabling remote management but requiring additional controls for security best practices. By default, it leverages Azure's baseline rules: allowing internal traffic within the Virtual Network, permitting traffic from the Azure Load Balancer, enabling outbound VM communication to the internet and within the VNet, and strictly denying all other inbound and outbound traffic to minimize exposure. No SKU or tags are specified, and the NSG must be explicitly associated with network interfaces or subnets to be effective; its configuration assumes dependency on a target VM or subnet. Critical for compliance and operational security, the "Allow SSH" rule has priority 300, ensuring management access, while the restrictive default rules enforce a least-privilege security posture and require careful consideration if expanding permitted traffic.
- **res-network-c17819eb**
  > Network Security Group (NSG) named andyye-windows-vm-nsg is deployed in the South Central US region, within the sparta_attackbot resource group, to secure and manage network traffic for a Windows virtual machine. This NSG allows inbound RDP traffic via TCP port 3389 (priority 300), enabling remote administrative access from any source, and enforces Azure default rules for network isolation and safe outbound/inbound behaviors, such as permitting VNET and load balancer traffic, and denying all other connections by default. The resource is configured with no explicit SKU, relies on default system rules for broad connectivity and security compliance, and includes critical access controls to protect resources from unauthorized network exposure. It is intended for attachment to a network interface or subnet associated with the VM, and should be carefully reviewed before production use due to the open RDP rule, which may require restriction to trusted IPs for enhanced security. Deployment requires connectivity to Azure networking resources and appropriate permissions within the selected subscription and resource group.

**Microsoft.Network/networkSecurityGroups** (1 items)

- **res-this-8de3dfce**
  > This resource is a custom Azure Network Security Group named **zixiaochen-AB-nsg** deployed in the **westus3** region within the resource group **sparta_attackbot**. Its primary purpose is to enforce network access controls for associated resources, specifically restricting inbound RDP (TCP/3389) traffic from any source by explicitly denying it for security and compliance reasons, as reported under S360. The NSG implements default rules to allow intra-VNet traffic, enable load balancer access, and permit outbound traffic to the internet, while denying all other inbound and outbound communications. It is explicitly associated with the network interface **zixiaochen-ab369_z1**, ensuring that only approved traffic patterns reach the connected VM or service. Key deployment considerations include the absence of SKU specialization, a high-priority custom deny rule for RDP (priority 300), default rules with priorities ranging from 65000 to 65500, and ensuring that NSG assignments align with both network segmentation and security policy requirements.

**Microsoft.Network/publicIPAddresses** (1 items)

- **res-azure-9dc66393**
  > Azure Static Public IP Address resource named **zixiaochen-AB-vnet-ip** provisioned in the **westus3** region is configured as an IPv4 address with a **Static** allocation method and a 4-minute idle timeout. This public IP is directly associated with a Bastion Host (**zixiaochen-AB-vnet-bastion**) via the [ANONYMIZED]on, enabling secure, browser-based RDP/SSH access to internal resources without exposing VMs to direct public internet access. The resource is deployed within the **sparta_attackbot** resource group and features no specific SKU, custom tags, or additional IP tags. Key settings include the assignment of a fixed IP address (**20.169.39.144**), which is critical for stable Bastion Host connectivity and external DNS configuration, as well as the default idle timeout, which can help mitigate certain types of denial-of-service scenarios. For full redeployment, ensure the Bastion Host and requisite virtual network and subnet are established before binding this static public IP.

  > This resource is an Azure Virtual Network named **zixiaochen-AB-vnet** deployed in **West US 3** for the **sparta_attackbot** resource group, designed as the foundational network layer for secure communication within the cloud environment. The VNet uses a single address space of **10.0.0.0/16**, and is segmented into two subnets: **AzureBastionSubnet** (10.0.1.0/26) for Azure Bastion host connectivity, and **default** (10.0.0.0/24) for general workloads, both with private endpoint policies disabled and private link service network policies enabled for secure service integrations. There are no virtual network peerings or delegations configured, and DDOS protection is explicitly disabled, meaning network traffic is not protected by Azure‚Äôs native DDOS mitigation services. The AzureBastionSubnet is configured to interface with an Azure Bastion host, while the default subnet is utilized by VM network interfaces, as referenced in the ipConfigurations properties.

  > **Technical Specification: Azure Network Security Group (NSG) ‚Äì "azlin-vm-1760819528NSG"**

This resource is a Network Security Group (NSG) named **"azlin-vm-1760819528NSG"**, deployed in the **westus2** region, designed to control inbound and outbound network traffic for associated Azure resources‚Äîmost commonly network interfaces or subnets attached to virtual machines within the same environment. The NSG‚Äôs primary security configuration is a custom security rule, **"default-allow-ssh"**, which *allows inbound TCP traffic on port 22 from any source* (for SSH access), prioritizing this rule with priority **1000**. In addition to this rule, the NSG enforces Azure‚Äôs standard default security rules including "AllowVnetInBound" and "AllowVnetOutBound" (enabling intra-VNET communication), "[ANONYMIZED]Bound" (accepting LB health probes), as well as "AllowInternetOutBound" (permitting egress to the Internet), while explicitly denying all other inbound and outbound traffic not matched by previous rules (with "DenyAllInBound" and "DenyAllOutBound" at priority 65500).

This NSG does not specify a particular SKU (uses default/empty), has no additional tags or SKU tiers, and is intended for deployment within the **rysweet-linux-vm-pool** resource group under subscription **[ANONYMIZED]**. The NSG is highly dependent on proper association with VM network interfaces or subnets to enforce these access policies. Critical security consideration: allowing SSH from any IP address ("*") presents a security exposure and should be restricted to trusted source addresses whenever possible to comply with security best practices. Deployment should ensure correct regional placement (**westus2**) and alignment with the target VM or subnet, with attention to custom rules and NSG association for effective traffic control.

  > This resource is a Network Security Group (NSG) named "azlin-vm-1760821977NSG" deployed in the "westus2" Azure region, designed to control inbound and outbound traffic for a Linux virtual machine within the "rysweet-linux-vm-pool" resource group. The NSG attaches to the network interface "AZLIN-VM-1760821977VMNIC" and implements a critical security rule to allow inbound SSH (TCP/22) from any source, enabling remote administrative access. Default security rules provide baseline protection by permitting intra-VNet communication and Azure Load Balancer traffic, allowing outbound access to the internet, and denying all other inbound and outbound connections‚Äîthereby enforcing strict traffic controls and compliance with Azure best practices.

  > The **rysweet-linux-vm-pool** Resource Group appears to be designed for hosting a pool of Linux-based virtual machines, likely for scenarios such as batch processing, container hosting, or scalable compute workloads that require secure and isolated network access. The architecture is centered on network security, evidenced by the large number of Network Security Groups (28) and Public IP addresses (28), suggesting individual VMs or containers are exposed or managed with distinct security policies‚Äîthis aligns with patterns like highly multi-tenant environments, jump-box pools, or dynamic scaling for developer/test environments. While only 2 virtual machines are currently active, the presence of 22 network interfaces hints at either rapid deployment/teardown cycles or preparations for scale-out activities, with a single virtual network and storage account supporting the overall connectivity and persistent storage needs within the **westus2** region.

  > This Resource Group, **RYSWEET-LINUX-VM-POOL**, appears to be dedicated to supporting a Linux-based compute pool, likely for scalable workloads such as virtual machine clusters or batch processing. The presence of 22 managed disks suggests a pattern where each disk is associated with an individual VM, though the VMs themselves may be provisioned dynamically or are possibly managed outside this Resource Group, supporting scenarios like stateless compute nodes, container host pools, or ephemeral workloads. Architecturally, this solution indicates a mid-scale deployment in a single region (West US 2), optimized for horizontal scaling and rapid resource provisioning, with the managed disks serving as persistent storage and the central component for compute workloads that require dedicated block storage per node.
