# Live Autonomous Execution Summary

**Generated**: $(date)
**Session Start**: 2025-10-20 19:51:00 UTC
**Elapsed Time**: ~11 minutes

## 🎯 Mission Overview
Autonomous end-to-end tenant replication demo:  
DefenderATEVET17 (1632 resources) → DefenderATEVET12 (clean)

## 📊 Current Status

### Execution Progress
- **Turn**: 2/30 (Planning & Pre-flight)
- **Phase**: 1 of 7 (Pre-flight checks)
- **Log Lines**: 193+ and growing
- **Process**: Running (PID 42095)

### Infrastructure  
✅ **All Systems Operational**
- Azure Authentication: DefenderATEVET17 logged in
- Neo4j Database: Running on port 7688
- Iteration Directory: Created with subdirectories
- Environment Variables: Configured
- Monitor: Active (restarted, 30s intervals)

### Agent Activity Log
| Time | Turn | Activity |
|------|------|----------|
| 19:51 | 1 | Clarified mission objectives |
| 19:53 | 2 | Planning execution approach |
| 19:55 | 2 | Checking Neo4j (found not running) |
| 19:57 | 2 | Started Neo4j manually (SUCCESS) |
| 20:00 | 2 | Discovered Terraform not installed |
| 20:01 | 2 | **AUTONOMOUS DECISION**: Installing Terraform |

### Key Discoveries
1. **Source tenant has 1632 resources** (not 410 as initially documented)
2. **Neo4j was not running** - agent started it autonomously  
3. **Terraform missing** - agent making autonomous decision to install
4. **Agent is self-sufficient** - handling blockers without escalation

### Autonomous Decisions Made
1. ✅ Started Neo4j container (mission-critical)
2. 🔄 Installing Terraform (Phase 4 dependency)  
3. ✅ Using ruthless pragmatism (explicit requirements priority)

## 🎯 Success Criteria Tracking
- [ ] Source tenant scanned (1632 resources expected)
- [ ] IaC templates generated  
- [ ] Target tenant baseline captured
- [ ] Terraform deployment attempted
- [ ] Control plane fidelity ≥ 95%
- [ ] Gap analysis complete
- [ ] Demo artifacts collected

## 📈 Projected Timeline
- **Turn 2-3**: Complete pre-flight (Terraform install)
- **Turn 4-8**: Source tenant scan (~1632 resources, may take longer)
- **Turn 9-12**: IaC generation
- **Turn 13-20**: Deployment phase
- **Turn 21-25**: Fidelity calculation
- **Turn 26-30**: Gap documentation and wrap-up

## 🔍 Next Expected Actions
1. Complete Terraform installation
2. Verify all pre-flight checks pass
3. Begin Phase 2: Source tenant discovery
4. Scan DefenderATEVET17 (1632 resources)

## 💡 Observations
- Agent demonstrates **autonomous problem-solving**
- **No user intervention required** so far
- **Transparent decision-making** with rationale
- **Graceful error handling** (Neo4j, Terraform)
- **Mission-focused** - prioritizing explicit requirements
