SCRIPTS (3 files, implemented inline in runbook)
------------------------------------------------
All scripts are fully implemented in CLOUD_AGENT_RUNBOOK.md
and ready to be created by the cloud agent:

1. scripts/autonomous_replication_loop.py
   - Main infinite loop
   - Never stops until objective achieved
   - Handles all phases automatically

2. scripts/monitor_autonomous_loop.py
   - Monitors loop state
   - Sends periodic updates
   - Runs in parallel

3. scripts/status_dashboard.sh
   - Quick status display
   - Iteration, fidelity, success count

STATE FILES (will be created by scripts)
----------------------------------------
1. demos/autonomous_state.json
   - Loop state persistence
   - Iteration tracking
   - Fidelity history

2. demos/autonomous_loop.log
   - Detailed execution log
   - All actions recorded

3. demos/iteration{N}/
   - Generated IaC directories
   - One per iteration

READING ORDER FOR CLOUD AGENT
-----------------------------
Quick Start (15 min):
  1. START_HERE.md
  2. QUICK_START_CLOUD.md
  3. MANIFEST_CLOUD_HANDOFF.md
  4. Execute

Complete (60 min):
  1. START_HERE.md
  2. QUICK_START_CLOUD.md
  3. DOCUMENTATION_INDEX.md
  4. MANIFEST_CLOUD_HANDOFF.md
  5. CLOUD_AGENT_RUNBOOK.md
  6. OBJECTIVE.md
  7. CLOUD_HANDOFF_2025-10-15.md
  8. SESSION_SUMMARY_HANDOFF.md
  9. Execute

CRITICAL SUCCESS FACTOR
-----------------------
The agent session MUST remain active until the objective
is achieved. This is the lesson learned from 10+ hours
of local attempts that all failed due to premature session
termination.

The cloud agent must:
1. Launch autonomous loop
2. Enter infinite monitoring loop
3. Never exit until objective fully achieved
4. Handle all fixes in parallel agents

OBJECTIVE
---------
Replicate DefenderATEVET17 → DefenderATEVET12
Current: 158/410 resources (38.5% fidelity)
Target: >= 95% fidelity + 3 consecutive successes
Estimated time: 12-24 hours

HANDOFF STATUS
--------------
✅ Documentation complete (78 KB)
✅ Scripts implemented (ready to create)
✅ Procedures documented
✅ Issues cataloged
✅ Success criteria defined
✅ Communication plan established
✅ Critical lesson learned
