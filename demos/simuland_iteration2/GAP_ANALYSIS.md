## GAP-014: Missing Subnet References (CRITICAL)

### Severity: CRITICAL
**Status**: BLOCKS DEPLOYMENT

### Description
8 network interfaces reference subnet `vnet_ljio3xx7w6o6y_snet_pe` which was not discovered/stored in Neo4j graph. The subnet exists in the source tenant but was not captured during discovery.

### Affected Resources
All affected resources are in resource group `ARTBAS-160224hpcp4rein6`:

1. `cm160224hpcp4rein6-blob-private-endpoint.nic.fb5d0aaa-3647-4862-9ca4-70a4038aa2fd`
2. `exec160224hpcp4rein6-file-private-endpoint.nic.efd5da1b-8201-494e_a3c8-44503c7b0a9a`

8. `exec160224hpcp4rein6-table-private-endpoint.nic.5f4832c2-6dc4-4f8f-b058-3212e57e2181`

### Missing Subnet Details
- **VNet Name**: `vnet-ljio3xx7w6o6y`
- **Subnet Name**: `snet-pe`
- **Expected Terraform Name**: `vnet_ljio3xx7w6o6y_snet_pe`
- **Azure ID**: `/subscriptions/9b00bc5e-9abc-45de-9958-02a9d9277b16/resourceGroups/ARTBAS-160224hpcp4rein6/providers/Microsoft.Network/virtualNetworks/vnet-ljio3xx7w6o6y/subnets/snet-pe`

### Root Cause Analysis

The subnet `snet-pe` was not discovered during the Azure discovery phase. Possible reasons:

1. **Discovery Filtering**: Subnet extraction logic may have filtered out subnets without address prefixes
2. **Parent Resource Discovery**: VNet `vnet-ljio3xx7w6o6y` may not have been fully discovered with all child subnets
3. **Resource Group Scope**: Discovery may have been scoped to specific resource groups, missing this VNet
4. **Timing Issue**: Subnet may have been created after initial discovery but before NICs were created
5. **API Response**: Azure API may not have returned subnet details in VNet properties

### Error Messages

```
Error: Reference to undeclared resource
  on main.tf.json line 1316, in resource.azurerm_network_interface.cm160224hpcp4rein6_blob_private_endpoint_nic_fb5d0aaa_3647_4862_9ca4_70a4038aa2fd.ip_configuration:

A managed resource "azurerm_subnet" "vnet_ljio3xx7w6o6y_snet_pe" has not been declared in the root module.
```

(+ 7 more similar errors)

### Impact Assessment

- **Blocking**: YES - Prevents terraform plan from succeeding
- **Affected Components**: Private endpoint network interfaces (8 resources)
- **Deployment Impact**: Cannot proceed to deployment phase
- **Scope**: Limited to one resource group (ARTBAS-160224hpcp4rein6)
- **Workaround Available**: Remove affected NICs or manually add subnet definition

### Recommended Fixes

#### Option 1: Enhance Discovery Service (PREFERRED)
Ensure all subnets are discovered and stored in Neo4j during initial scan:

```python
# In src/services/azure_discovery_service.py
# Ensure subnet discovery includes all subnets regardless of address prefix
async def discover_subnets(self, vnet_resource):
    """Discover all subnets in a VNet, including those without address prefixes"""
    for subnet in vnet_resource.get("properties", {}).get("subnets", []):
        # Store subnet even if addressPrefix is None
        await self.store_subnet(subnet, allow_missing_prefix=True)
```

#### Option 2: IaC Emitter Validation (SHORT-TERM)
Implement comprehensive reference validation before emitting resources:

```python
# In src/iac/emitters/terraform_emitter.py
def validate_subnet_references(self, network_interfaces):
    """Validate all subnet references before emitting NICs"""
    missing_subnets = []
    for nic in network_interfaces:
        subnet_ref = extract_subnet_reference(nic)
        if not subnet_exists_in_resources(subnet_ref):
            missing_subnets.append(subnet_ref)
            # Either skip NIC or create synthetic subnet
    return missing_subnets
```

#### Option 3: Manual Workaround (IMMEDIATE)
Manually comment out the 8 affected NICs in generated Terraform or add synthetic subnet definition:

```json
"azurerm_subnet": {
  "vnet_ljio3xx7w6o6y_snet_pe": {
    "name": "snet-pe",
    "resource_group_name": "ARTBAS-160224hpcp4rein6",
    "virtual_network_name": "vnet-ljio3xx7w6o6y",
    "address_prefixes": ["10.0.1.0/24"]
  }
}
```

### Testing Strategy

1. **Verify Discovery**: Check if VNet `vnet-ljio3xx7w6o6y` exists in Neo4j and contains subnet `snet-pe`
2. **Re-scan Targeted**: Run discovery specifically for resource group `ARTBAS-160224hpcp4rein6`
3. **Validate Extraction**: Check subnet extraction logic for subnets with private endpoint service delegation
4. **Integration Test**: Create test case with private endpoints and validate subnet discovery

### Priority for ITERATION 3

**Priority**: HIGH

This gap blocks deployment and affects a common Azure pattern (private endpoints). Fixing this will likely unblock multiple other resource groups and significantly increase deployment fidelity.

## Gaps Resolved from ITERATION 1

All 3 gaps from ITERATION 1 were successfully resolved by PR #343:

### GAP-011: NSG Association Generation (RESOLVED)
- **Status**: FIXED in PR #343
- **Evidence**: No NSG association errors in validation

### GAP-012: VNet Address Space Validation (RESOLVED)
- **Status**: FIXED in PR #343
- **Evidence**: Address space validation passed during IaC generation

### GAP-013: Subnet Name Collisions (RESOLVED)
- **Status**: FIXED in PR #343
- **Evidence**: VNet-scoped subnet naming implemented, 4 collisions detected but handled

## Additional Observations

### Warnings (Non-Blocking)
- **Deprecated Resource**: `azurerm_app_service` is deprecated (2 warnings)
  - Recommendation: Migrate to `azurerm_linux_web_app` or `azurerm_windows_web_app`

## Additional Gaps Identified (Post-Analysis)

### GAP-015: Limited Resource Type Support (MEDIUM)

**Category**: Code Coverage
**Severity**: MEDIUM
**Status**: OPEN

**Description**: 221 resources (39.8% of source) were skipped during IaC generation due to unsupported resource types. This significantly limits the maximum achievable fidelity.

**Impact**:
- Current maximum theoretical fidelity: 60.2%
- With full resource type support: Could reach 100%

**Skipped Resource Breakdown**:
1. Microsoft.Compute/disks (66 resources, 11.9%)
2. Microsoft.Compute/virtualMachines/extensions (59 resources, 10.6%)
3. Microsoft.Automation/automationAccounts/runbooks (29 resources, 5.2%)
4. Microsoft.DevTestLab/labs/virtualMachines (16 resources, 2.9%)
5. Microsoft.Network/privateDnsZones (7 resources, 1.3%)
6. Microsoft.Network/privateEndpoints (7 resources, 1.3%)
7. Other types (37 resources, 6.7%)

**Recommended Remediation** (prioritized by business value):

1. **Private Endpoints** (7 resources, HIGH priority):
   - Add `azurerm_private_endpoint` emitter
   - Required for secure Azure architectures
   - Time estimate: 3-4 hours

2. **Private DNS Zones** (7 resources, HIGH priority):
   - Add `azurerm_private_dns_zone` emitter
   - Add `azurerm_private_dns_zone_virtual_network_link` emitter
   - Required with private endpoints
   - Time estimate: 3-4 hours

3. **VM Extensions** (59 resources, MEDIUM priority):
   - Add `azurerm_virtual_machine_extension` emitter
   - Handle complex extension configurations
   - Time estimate: 6-8 hours

4. **Managed Disks** (66 resources, MEDIUM priority):
   - Consider if explicit disk resources needed (VMs auto-create OS disks)
   - Add support for data disks only
   - Time estimate: 4-6 hours

5. **Automation Runbooks** (29 resources, LOW priority):
   - Add `azurerm_automation_runbook` emitter
   - Handle runbook content and schedules
   - Time estimate: 8-12 hours

**Priority for ITERATION 3**: Focus on Private Endpoints and Private DNS Zones (items 1 and 2), which would add 14 resources and increase fidelity by ~2.5%.

**Workstream**: Resource Type Expansion

### GAP-016: Missing NICs and VMs (MEDIUM)

**Category**: Resource Dependencies
**Severity**: MEDIUM
**Status**: OPEN

**Description**: 9 virtual machines (13.8% of VMs) were not generated, likely due to missing or invalid dependencies.

**Details**:
- Expected VMs: 65

- Missing VMs: 9

**Known Issues**:
- VM `csiska-01` references missing NIC `csiska-01654`
- Some VMs may reference subnets that were not discovered
- Potential circular dependency issues

**Impact**: Reduces VM replication fidelity and may affect related resources (disks, extensions).

**Recommended Remediation**:
1. Enhance dependency validation during IaC generation
2. Add comprehensive logging for missing dependencies
3. Implement dependency graph visualization
4. Consider generating "stub" resources for missing dependencies
5. Investigate why certain NICs were not discovered

**Testing**:
1. Audit all VM-to-NIC references
2. Validate NIC-to-subnet references
3. Check for circular dependencies
4. Add integration tests for complex dependency chains

**Priority for ITERATION 3**: MEDIUM

**Workstream**: Dependency Resolution

### GAP-017: Incomplete Subnet Discovery (MEDIUM)

**Category**: Resource Discovery
**Severity**: MEDIUM
**Status**: OPEN

**Description**: 4 subnets (13.8% of subnets) were not generated despite being present in the source tenant.

**Details**:
- Expected Subnets: 29
- Generated Subnets: 25
- Missing Subnets: 4

**Possible Causes**:
1. Subnets not discovered (similar to GAP-014)
2. Subnets filtered out due to missing properties
3. Subnets skipped due to validation failures
4. Subnets with special delegations or configurations

**Impact**: May cause downstream failures for resources that depend on these subnets.

**Recommended Remediation**:
1. Add comprehensive subnet discovery logging
2. Ensure all subnet properties are captured
3. Handle subnets with missing or null address prefixes
4. Validate subnet discovery completeness
5. Add special handling for delegated subnets

**Testing**:
1. Compare discovered subnets with Azure portal/CLI
2. Check for subnets with special service delegations
3. Validate subnet extraction from VNet properties
4. Add integration tests for subnet discovery

**Priority for ITERATION 3**: HIGH (related to GAP-014)

**Workstream**: Discovery Enhancement

### GAP-018: VNet Coverage Gap (LOW)

**Details**:
- Expected Public IPs: 12
- Generated Public IPs: 10
- Missing Public IPs: 2

**Impact**: Low - may affect bastion hosts or VMs that require public connectivity.

**Recommended Remediation**:
1. Investigate why certain public IPs were skipped
2. Check if these are system-generated IPs (e.g., for Azure services)
3. Ensure public IP discovery includes all allocation types (static, dynamic)
4. Validate public IP dependencies

**Priority for ITERATION 3**: LOW

**Workstream**: Resource Coverage

### GAP-020: Bastion Host Coverage Gap (LOW)

**Category**: Resource Generation
**Severity**: LOW
**Status**: OPEN

**Description**: 2 Bastion hosts (16.7% of Bastion hosts) were not generated.

**Details**:
- Expected Bastion Hosts: 12
- Generated Bastion Hosts: 10
