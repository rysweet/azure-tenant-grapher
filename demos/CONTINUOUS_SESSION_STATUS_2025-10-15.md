| fix_Microsoft_Network_privateEndpoints_1760548505 | Microsoft.Network/privateEndpoints | 🔄 RUNNING | 7 |

#### ⚠️ Issues Identified

1. **IAC Generation Performance**
   - Problem: Generation taking >10 minutes, causing timeouts
   - Impact: Wasting iteration numbers, slowing progress
   - Root Cause: Performance bottleneck in terraform_emitter.py or conflict detection
   - Action Needed: Profile and optimize generation code

2. **Zombie Processes**
   - Problem: Timed-out subprocess.run() doesn't kill child processes
   - Impact: Hung `atg generate-iac` processes accumulate
   - Fix Applied: Killed hung processes manually
   - Future Fix: Use Popen with terminate() instead of subprocess.run()

3. **Fidelity Not Increasing**
   - Problem: Fidelity stuck at 38.5%
   - Reason: Resources being generated but not deployed to target
   - Explanation: Need to complete 3 consecutive successful validations before deployment
   - Status: Currently at 2/3 consecutive passes (iterations 186, 187)

#### 📈 Progress Timeline

- **17:15** - Engine started
- **17:15** - Loop #1: Generated iteration 186, validation PASSED (1/3)
- **17:16** - Loop #2: Generated iteration 187, validation PASSED (2/3)
- **17:17-17:26** - Loop #3: Iteration 188 generation TIMEOUT (10 min)
- **17:27** - Loop #4: Workstream fix_Microsoft_Network_privateDnsZones COMPLETED ✅
- **17:27-17:37** - Loop #4: Iteration 189 generation TIMEOUT (10 min)
- **17:38+** - Loop #5+: Continuing...

#### 🎯 Next Steps

1. **Immediate (Engine Handles)**
   - Continue generation attempts
   - Once iteration validates successfully, will be 3/3 consecutive passes
   - Will trigger deployment to target tenant
   - Will rescan target and update fidelity metrics

2. **Performance Fix (Needed in Parallel)**
   - Profile IAC generation to find bottleneck
   - Likely candidates:
     - Azure API calls during conflict detection
     - Neo4j query performance
     - Terraform resource processing loop
   - Optimize hot path
   - Test generation completes in <2 minutes

3. **Missing Resource Types**
   From earlier analysis, these types exist in source but not yet generated:
   - Microsoft.Automation/automationAccounts (4 resources)
   - Microsoft.CognitiveServices/accounts (5 resources)
   - Microsoft.Compute/sshPublicKeys (6 resources)
   - Microsoft.DevTestLab/schedules (2 resources)
   - Microsoft.EventHub/namespaces (2 resources)
   - Microsoft.Insights/components (1 resource)
   - Microsoft.Insights/dataCollectionEndpoints (1 resource)
   - Microsoft.Insights/dataCollectionRules (3 resources)
   - Microsoft.Kusto/clusters (2 resources)
   - Microsoft.MachineLearningServices/workspaces (5 resources)
   - Microsoft.MachineLearningServices/workspaces/serverlessEndpoints (4 resources)
   - Microsoft.Network/privateDnsZones (7 resources) - Being worked on ✅
   - Microsoft.Network/privateDnsZones/virtualNetworkLinks (6 resources)
   - Microsoft.Network/privateEndpoints (7 resources) - Being worked on 🔄
   - Microsoft.OperationsManagement/solutions (1 resource)
   - Microsoft.Resources/templateSpecs (1 resource)
   - Microsoft.Resources/templateSpecs/versions (1 resource)
   - Microsoft.Search/searchServices (1 resource)
   - Microsoft.SecurityCopilot/capacities (1 resource)

   **Note**: Many of these already have Terraform mappings in `terraform_emitter.py`. The issue is not missing mappings, but that resources aren't being deployed yet.

#### 🔍 Objective Evaluation

From `/Users/ryan/src/msec/atg-0723/azure-tenant-grapher/demos/OBJECTIVE.md`:

**Target**: 100% infrastructure fidelity (95%+ resources, 3 consecutive validation passes, successful deployment)

**Current Status**:
- ❌ Fidelity: 38.5% (need 95%+)
- 🔄 Validation: 2/3 consecutive passes
- ⏳ Deployment: Not yet attempted
- ⏳ Post-deploy scan: Pending deployment

**Gaps to Close**:
1. Complete 3rd consecutive validation pass → trigger deployment
2. Deploy iteration to target tenant → increases fidelity
3. Rescan target tenant → updates metrics
4. Iterate until fidelity >95%

#### 💡 Key Insight

The current approach of generating iterations rapidly is hitting a performance wall. The engine is working correctly (continues after errors, spawns workstreams), but:

1. IAC generation is too slow (>10 min)
2. No deployments have happened yet (stuck at validation phase)
3. Fidelity won't increase until we deploy

**Recommendation**: Focus on performance optimization of IAC generation as Priority #1. Once generation is fast (<2 min), the iteration loop will accelerate and deployments will begin.

#### 🚀 Session Persistence

This session will continue running until:
1. Objective achieved (95%+ fidelity), OR
2. User interrupts

The engine, monitor, and keeper processes will continue autonomously. Session is being actively monitored to prevent stopping.
