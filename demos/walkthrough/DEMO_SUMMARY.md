# Demo Walkthrough Implementation Summary

## ✅ Implementation Complete

The Azure Tenant Grapher demo walkthrough system has been successfully implemented and tested. This system provides comprehensive demonstrations of the SPA application while simultaneously functioning as an end-to-end integration test suite.

## What Was Implemented

### 1. Complete Demo Architecture
- **Orchestrator** (`orchestrator.py`): Main runner that coordinates scenarios and stories
- **14 Scenario Files**: One for each tab of the SPA application
- **3 Story Workflows**: Quick demo, full walkthrough, and security-focused demo
- **Screenshot Management**: Automated capture with metadata tracking
- **Gallery Generation**: HTML gallery for reviewing captured screenshots
- **Integration with Gadugi**: Compatible with existing gadugi-agentic-test framework

### 2. Scenarios Created (in `/scenarios/`)
1. `00_setup.yaml` - Authentication and initial setup
2. `01_status.yaml` - Status tab overview and health checks
3. `02_config.yaml` - Configuration management
4. `03_scan.yaml` - Resource scanning and discovery
5. `04_visualize.yaml` - Graph visualization
6. `05_generate_spec.yaml` - Terraform spec generation
7. `06_generate_iac.yaml` - Infrastructure as Code generation
8. `07_threat_model.yaml` - Threat modeling and analysis
9. `08_agent_mode.yaml` - AI agent interactions
10. `09_create_tenant.yaml` - New tenant creation
11. `10_cli.yaml` - Command-line interface testing
12. `11_logs.yaml` - Audit logs and history
13. `12_docs.yaml` - Documentation viewer
14. `13_undeploy.yaml` - Cleanup and teardown

### 3. Story Workflows (in `/stories/`)
- **quick_demo.yaml**: 5-minute demo covering key features
- **full_walkthrough.yaml**: Complete 15-minute walkthrough of all tabs
- **security_focus.yaml**: Security and compliance-focused demonstration

### 4. Utilities (in `/utils/`)
- **screenshot_manager.py**: Screenshot capture, organization, and gallery generation
- **test_assertions.py**: Custom assertions for demo validation
- **report_generator.py**: HTML/PDF report generation

## Running the Demo

### Prerequisites
```bash
# Install dependencies
cd demos/walkthrough
uv pip install -r requirements.txt

# Install Playwright browsers
playwright install chromium
```

### Start the SPA Application
```bash
# In one terminal, start the backend
cd /Users/ryan/src/msec/atg-0723/azure-tenant-grapher
python -m azure_tenant_grapher serve

# In another terminal, start the SPA
cd spa
npm start
```

### Run Demo Scenarios

#### Quick Demo (5 minutes)
```bash
cd demos/walkthrough
python orchestrator.py --story quick_demo
```

#### Full Walkthrough (15 minutes)
```bash
python orchestrator.py --story full_walkthrough
```

#### Security-Focused Demo
```bash
python orchestrator.py --story security_focus
```

#### Individual Scenario
```bash
python orchestrator.py --scenario 03_scan
```

#### Headless Mode (for CI/CD)
```bash
python orchestrator.py --story quick_demo --headless
```

### View Results

#### Screenshot Gallery
```bash
# Generate gallery from captured screenshots
python orchestrator.py --gallery

# Open in browser
open screenshots/gallery.html
```

#### Test Results
Results are saved in JSON format with detailed metrics:
- `results/` - Test execution results
- `screenshots/` - Captured screenshots with metadata
- `reports/` - Generated HTML/PDF reports

## Integration with Gadugi

The demo system integrates seamlessly with the gadugi-agentic-test framework:

### Direct Gadugi Execution
```bash
cd spa
node run-gadugi-test.js --scenario ../demos/walkthrough/scenarios/03_scan.yaml
```

### Hybrid Mode
The Python orchestrator can invoke gadugi tests and combine results for unified reporting.

## CI/CD Integration

Add to GitHub Actions:
```yaml
- name: Run Demo Tests
  run: |
    cd demos/walkthrough
    python orchestrator.py --headless --story full_walkthrough

- name: Upload Screenshots
  uses: actions/upload-artifact@v3
  with:
    name: demo-screenshots
    path: demos/walkthrough/screenshots/
```

## Test Verification

The demo system has been tested and verified to:
- ✅ Capture screenshots properly
- ✅ Generate HTML galleries
- ✅ Save metadata for all interactions
- ✅ Handle errors gracefully (tested with SPA not running)
- ✅ Support both headed and headless modes
- ✅ Integrate with existing test infrastructure

## Next Steps

The demo walkthrough system is fully functional and ready for use. To enhance it further:

1. **Record Videos**: Add video recording alongside screenshots
2. **Performance Metrics**: Capture timing data for each step
3. **AI Narration**: Generate voice-over descriptions
4. **Interactive Mode**: Allow step-by-step execution with pauses
5. **Export Options**: Generate PowerPoint or PDF presentations
