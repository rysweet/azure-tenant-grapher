## Workflow for Implementing Features

When implementing new features or fixing issues, follow this workflow:

1. **Create a new issue in the repo** with a descriptive title and detailed description
2. **Analyze the issue** and capture requirements and design, update the issue
3. **Break down into smaller tasks** if needed
4. **Create a feature branch** following naming convention (feature/issue-XXX-description)
5. **Write failing tests first**, then implement the fix
6. **Write additional unit and integration tests**
7. **Run all tests** to ensure everything passes
8. **Update documentation** as needed
9. **Run pre-commit hooks and linters**
10. **Push branch and create PR**
11. **Review PR** and provide feedback
12. **Address feedback** and iterate until CI passes
13. **Merge PR** once approved and CI passes
