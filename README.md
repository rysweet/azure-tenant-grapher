# Azure Tenant Grapher

Azure Tenant Grapher discovers every resource in your Azure tenant, stores the results in a richly-typed Neo4j graph, and offers tooling to visualize, document, and recreate your cloud environment â€” including Infrastructure-as-Code generation, AI-powered summaries, and narrative description to simulated tenant creation.

- **Threat Modeling Agent** for automated DFD creation, threat enumeration, and Markdown reports.
- **Automated CLI tool management** and cross-platform support.
- **Database backup & restore utilities** for Neo4j.

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- Python **3.8+**
- [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) (recommended for dependency management)
- Docker & Docker Compose (for Neo4j)
- Azure CLI & Bicep CLI (for authentication and IaC deployment)

### Create & Explore Your Graph

```bash
# 1. Install dependencies
uv sync

# 2. Activate the virtual environment
source .venv/bin/activate

# 3. Copy and edit environment variables
cp .env.example .env

# 4. Authenticate with Azure
az login --tenant <your-tenant-id>

# 5. Build the graph with the interactive dashboard
azure-tenant-grapher build --tenant-id <your-tenant-id>

# 6. Visualize your Azure graph in 3D
azure-tenant-grapher visualize
```

## Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/<org>/azure-tenant-grapher.git
cd azure-tenant-grapher

# Sync dependencies and create a .venv
uv sync
source .venv/bin/activate

# Note:
# All runtime dependencies are managed in pyproject.toml.
# requirements.txt is provided for compatibility, but you must keep both files in sync.
# If you add a new dependency, add it to pyproject.toml and run 'uv sync' to update the lockfile and your environment.

# Configure environment variables
cp .env.example .env
az login
```
## Dependency Management

All runtime dependencies **must** be listed in [`pyproject.toml`](pyproject.toml) under the `[project.dependencies]` section.
The [`requirements.txt`](requirements.txt) file is provided for compatibility with some tools, but it is not the source of truth.
Whenever you add, remove, or update a dependency, you **must**:

1. Edit `pyproject.toml` to reflect the change.
2. Run `uv sync` to update your environment and the lockfile.
3. Ensure `requirements.txt` is updated to match `pyproject.toml`.

> **Note:** Keeping `pyproject.toml` and `requirements.txt` in sync is required for correct installation and CI compatibility.
> Do **not** add dependencies to `requirements.txt` directlyâ€”always update `pyproject.toml` first.


## Usage

```bash
# Build the Azure graph
azure-tenant-grapher build --tenant-id <your-tenant-id>

# Rebuildâ€”all relationships will be re-evaluated
azure-tenant-grapher build --tenant-id <your-tenant-id> --rebuild-edges
```

### Agent Mode

Ask natural-language questions about your tenant. The agent chains tool calls (via the MCP server) to query Neo4j and return answers.

```bash
# Interactive REPL
azure-tenant-grapher agent-mode

# One-off question
azure-tenant-grapher agent-mode --question "How many storage resources are in the tenant?"
```

<details><summary>Example session</summary>

```text
MCP Agent is ready
ðŸ¤– Processing question: How many storage resources are in the tenant?
ðŸ”„ Step 1: Getting database schema...
âœ… Schema retrieved
ðŸ”„ Step 2: Querying for storage resources...
âœ… Query executed
ðŸ”„ Step 3: Processing results...
ðŸŽ¯ Final Answer: There are 3 storage resources in the tenant.
```

</details>

### Generate Tenant Specification

Generate an anonymized tenant specification (YAML/JSON) for documentation, sharing, or further processing.

```bash
azure-tenant-grapher generate-spec \
  --tenant-id <your-tenant-id> \
  --output ./my-tenant-spec.yaml
```

### MCP Server

Run the MCP server to enable agent mode and natural language queries.

```bash
# Start the MCP server
uv run azure-tenant-grapher mcp-server
```

### Generate & Deploy IaC

```bash
# Generate Bicep for a subset of resources
azure-tenant-grapher generate-iac \
  --format bicep \
  --subset-filter "types=Microsoft.Storage/*" \
  --rules-file ./config/replica-rules.yaml \
  --dest-rg "replica-rg" \
  --location "East US" \
  --output ./my-deployment

# Deploy the generated templates
cd my-deployment
./deploy.sh
```

### Threat Modeling agent example - example of using the MCP server in an agent.

See [./src/threat_model_agent/](./src/threat_model_agent/)

Generate a Data Flow Diagram, enumerate threats, and produce a Markdown report for your tenant.

```bash
azure-tenant-grapher threat-model --spec-path ./my-tenant-spec.md --summaries-path ./summaries.json
```

### Database Backup

```bash
azure-tenant-grapher backup-db ./my-neo4j-backup.dump
```

### IaC Subset & Rules System

Details in [`docs/design/iac_subset_bicep.md`](docs/design/iac_subset_bicep.md).


## Development & Testing

### Test Output and Artifact Cleanup

All integration tests that invoke the CLI will print the full CLI stdout and stderr on failure, making it easy to debug issues. Test artifacts (such as simdoc files, temporary files, and containers) are always cleaned up after tests, even if a test fails.

Run the full test suite (unit, integration, end-to-end):

```bash
uv run pytest -n auto
```
