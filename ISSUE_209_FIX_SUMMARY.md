# Issue #209 Fix Summary

## Problem
Neo4j queries were referencing non-existent properties on User nodes due to inconsistent property naming conventions between different parts of the codebase.

## Root Cause
- `src/tenant_creator.py` was creating User nodes with snake_case properties (e.g., `display_name`, `user_principal_name`)
- `src/services/aad_graph_service.py` was creating User nodes with camelCase properties (e.g., `displayName`, `userPrincipalName`)
- This inconsistency meant queries looking for `userPrincipalName` would fail to find users created by tenant_creator.py

## Solution
Updated `src/tenant_creator.py` to use camelCase properties consistently with `aad_graph_service.py`.

### Files Modified

1. **src/tenant_creator.py**
   - Changed User node properties from snake_case to camelCase:
     - `u.display_name` → `u.displayName`
     - `u.user_principal_name` → `u.userPrincipalName`
     - `u.job_title` → `u.jobTitle`
     - Added `u.mailNickname` property
   - Also updated other identity nodes for consistency:
     - IdentityGroup: `g.display_name` → `g.displayName`
     - ServicePrincipal: `sp.display_name` → `sp.displayName`
     - ManagedIdentity: `mi.display_name` → `mi.displayName`
     - AdminUnit: `au.display_name` → `au.displayName`
     - Tenant: `t.display_name` → `t.displayName`

### Files Created

1. **tests/test_neo4j_property_consistency.py**
   - Comprehensive test suite to verify property consistency
   - Tests that both tenant_creator and aad_service use camelCase
   - Verifies queries can find users by userPrincipalName

2. **test_property_fix.py**
   - Quick verification script to confirm the fix
   - Checks both files for correct property usage

## Verification
The fix has been verified by:
1. Checking that both files now use camelCase properties consistently
2. Confirming User nodes will have: `displayName`, `userPrincipalName`, `jobTitle`, `mailNickname`
3. Ensuring queries like `MATCH (u:User {userPrincipalName: $upn})` will now work correctly

## Impact
This fix ensures that:
- User nodes created by any part of the system have consistent property names
- Cypher queries can reliably find users by their properties
- The graph database maintains a consistent schema for all identity nodes
