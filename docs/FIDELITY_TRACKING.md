# Fidelity Tracking

## Overview

The `atg fidelity` command calculates and tracks resource replication fidelity between Azure subscriptions. This is particularly useful for measuring how accurately resources have been replicated from a source subscription to a target subscription.

## Features

- **Resource Count Comparison**: Compares total resources between source and target subscriptions
- **Resource Type Analysis**: Calculates fidelity by resource type (e.g., VMs, VNets, Storage Accounts)
- **Relationship Tracking**: Compares relationship/edge counts between subscriptions
- **Time-Series Tracking**: Append fidelity metrics to JSONL file for historical analysis
- **JSON Export**: Export detailed metrics to JSON format
- **OBJECTIVE.md Integration**: Check if fidelity meets criteria defined in OBJECTIVE.md

## Command Usage

### Basic Usage

Calculate fidelity between two subscriptions:

```bash
uv run atg fidelity \
  --source-subscription 9b00bc5e-9abc-45de-9958-02a9d9277b16 \
  --target-subscription c190c55a-9ab2-4b1e-92c4-cc8b1a032285
```

### Track Fidelity Over Time

Append metrics to `demos/fidelity_history.jsonl` for time-series analysis:

```bash
uv run atg fidelity \
  --source-subscription 9b00bc5e-9abc-45de-9958-02a9d9277b16 \
  --target-subscription c190c55a-9ab2-4b1e-92c4-cc8b1a032285 \
  --track
```

### Export to JSON

Export metrics to a JSON file:

```bash
uv run atg fidelity \
  --source-subscription 9b00bc5e-9abc-45de-9958-02a9d9277b16 \
  --target-subscription c190c55a-9ab2-4b1e-92c4-cc8b1a032285 \
  --output fidelity_report_2025-10-17.json
```

### Check Against Objective

Verify if fidelity meets the target specified in OBJECTIVE.md:

```bash
uv run atg fidelity \
  --source-subscription 9b00bc5e-9abc-45de-9958-02a9d9277b16 \
  --target-subscription c190c55a-9ab2-4b1e-92c4-cc8b1a032285 \
  --check-objective demos/OBJECTIVE.md
```

### Combined Options

Use multiple options together:

```bash
uv run atg fidelity \
  --source-subscription 9b00bc5e-9abc-45de-9958-02a9d9277b16 \
  --target-subscription c190c55a-9ab2-4b1e-92c4-cc8b1a032285 \
  --track \
  --output current_fidelity.json \
  --check-objective demos/OBJECTIVE.md
```

## Fidelity Calculation

### Overall Fidelity

Overall fidelity is calculated as:

```
Overall Fidelity = (Target Resources / Source Resources) × 100
```

For example, if source has 1000 resources and target has 800 resources:
```
Overall Fidelity = (800 / 1000) × 100 = 80.0%
```

### Fidelity by Resource Type

Fidelity is calculated for each resource type individually:

```
Type Fidelity = (Target Count / Source Count) × 100
```

For example, if source has 100 VMs and target has 85 VMs:
```
VM Fidelity = (85 / 100) × 100 = 85.0%
```

## Time-Series Tracking

When using the `--track` flag, metrics are appended to `demos/fidelity_history.jsonl` in JSONL format (one JSON object per line). This allows you to:

1. Track fidelity improvements over multiple iterations
2. Analyze trends and convergence toward target fidelity
3. Generate visualizations of fidelity over time

Example JSONL format:

```jsonl
{"timestamp": "2025-10-17T00:00:00Z", "source": {...}, "target": {...}, "fidelity": {"overall": 25.5, ...}}
{"timestamp": "2025-10-17T01:00:00Z", "source": {...}, "target": {...}, "fidelity": {"overall": 30.8, ...}}
{"timestamp": "2025-10-17T02:00:00Z", "source": {...}, "target": {...}, "fidelity": {"overall": 42.3, ...}}
```

## OBJECTIVE.md Integration

The `--check-objective` flag reads an OBJECTIVE.md file to determine the target fidelity percentage. The parser looks for patterns like:

- "95% fidelity"
- "fidelity: 95%"
- "target: 95%"

Example OBJECTIVE.md:

```markdown
# Objective

Replicate the source subscription to the target subscription with at least 95% fidelity.

## Success Criteria

- Overall fidelity >= 95%
- All critical resource types replicated
- Relationships preserved
```

The command will report whether the objective is met based on the calculated overall fidelity.

## Integration with Iteration Workflow

The fidelity command integrates with the iteration workflow described in `ATG_ITERATION_WORKFLOW_IMPROVEMENTS.md`:

1. **Generate IaC**: Use `atg generate-iac` to create Terraform templates from source subscription
2. **Deploy**: Deploy the generated IaC to target subscription using `atg deploy` (or `terraform apply`)
3. **Scan Target**: Run `atg scan` on the target subscription to populate Neo4j
4. **Calculate Fidelity**: Use `atg fidelity` to measure replication accuracy
5. **Iterate**: Repeat steps 1-4 until target fidelity is achieved

Example workflow:

```bash
# Step 1-2: Generate and deploy (not shown)

# Step 3: Scan target subscription
uv run atg scan --filter-by-subscriptions c190c55a-9ab2-4b1e-92c4-cc8b1a032285

# Step 4: Calculate fidelity
uv run atg fidelity \
  --source-subscription 9b00bc5e-9abc-45de-9958-02a9d9277b16 \
  --target-subscription c190c55a-9ab2-4b1e-92c4-cc8b1a032285 \
  --track \
  --check-objective demos/OBJECTIVE.md

# Step 5: If objective not met, iterate
```

## Troubleshooting

### Subscription Not Found

If you see "Source subscription not found" or "Target subscription not found", ensure:

1. Neo4j is running and accessible
2. Both subscriptions have been scanned and data exists in Neo4j
3. Subscription IDs are correct (UUIDs, not names)

### Empty Fidelity by Type

If `fidelity_by_type` is empty, the source subscription may have no resources of any type. Verify the source subscription data in Neo4j.

### No Neo4j Connection

Ensure `NEO4J_URI` or `NEO4J_PORT` and `NEO4J_PASSWORD` environment variables are set correctly.
