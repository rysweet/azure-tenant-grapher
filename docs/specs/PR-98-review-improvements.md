# PR #98 Review: Improvements & Refactoring Recommendations

## 1. LLM Prompt/Response Handling

- **Clarify and centralize LLM post-processing:**
  Move all field normalization (e.g., `roleDefinitionName` → `role`, `principalId` → `principal_id`) into a single, well-documented function.
  Add a schema-driven mapping table for future extensibility.

- **Robust error handling for LLM output:**
  If the LLM returns invalid or empty JSON, provide a clear error message and include the prompt and raw response for debugging.

- **Prompt engineering:**
  Add more explicit field name requirements and examples in the LLM prompt to reduce the need for post-processing.

## 2. Neo4j Container/Test Setup

- **Test fixture reliability:**
  Instead of only removing containers/volumes, consider using a unique container name per test run (e.g., with a random suffix) to avoid race conditions and port conflicts in parallel CI.

- **Password management:**
  Document the test password policy in the test file and README.
  Consider supporting a random password for each test run, passed via environment, to avoid accidental reuse in other environments.

- **Timeouts and retries:**
  Make the Neo4j readiness timeout and retry logic configurable via environment variables for CI tuning.

## 3. CLI and Test UX

- **CLI error messages:**
  Ensure all CLI error messages are user-friendly and actionable, especially for LLM and Neo4j failures.

- **Test output clarity:**
  In integration tests, always print the full CLI stdout/stderr on failure for easier debugging.

- **Test idempotency:**
  Ensure all test artifacts (e.g., simdoc files, containers) are cleaned up after tests, even on failure.

## 4. Data Model Clarity

- **Pydantic model docstrings:**
  Add docstrings to all Pydantic models (User, Group, RBACAssignment, etc.) to clarify expected fields and usage.

- **Schema validation:**
  Consider using Pydantic's `alias_generator` or `Field(..., alias=...)` to handle common LLM field name variants automatically.

## 5. Error Handling and Logging

- **Consistent exception chaining:**
  Ensure all `raise ...` in `except` blocks use `from e` for clarity and compliance.

- **Logging best practices:**
  Use structured logging for key events (e.g., LLM call, Neo4j connection, test setup/teardown) to aid debugging in CI.

## Prioritized List

1. Centralize and document LLM post-processing and field normalization.
2. Add robust error handling and prompt/response logging for LLM failures.
3. Make Neo4j test container setup more robust (unique names, configurable timeouts).
4. Improve CLI and test error messages and output for easier debugging.
5. Add docstrings and field aliases to Pydantic models for clarity and LLM compatibility.
6. Ensure all exception handling uses `raise ... from e`.
7. Use structured logging for key events and errors.
