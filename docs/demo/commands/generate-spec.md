## generate-spec

The `generate-spec` command creates an anonymized tenant specification from the graph, suitable for sharing or further processing. The `--limit` flag restricts the number of resources for faster runs and easier testing. Requires a running Neo4j database.

```bash
uv run azure-tenant-grapher generate-spec --limit 3
```

**Output:**
```text
INFO:src.config_manager:üìù Logging configured: level=INFO, file=console

**Troubleshooting:**
- If you see a connection error, ensure Neo4j is running and accessible at the configured URI. The graph must be built before running this command.
