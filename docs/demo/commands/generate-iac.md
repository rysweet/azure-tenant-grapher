## generate-iac

The `generate-iac` command generates Infrastructure-as-Code (IaC) templates from your Azure graph. The `--dry-run` flag allows you to test the command without writing files. Requires a running Neo4j database.

```bash
uv run azure-tenant-grapher generate-iac --dry-run
```

**Output:**
```text

**Troubleshooting:**
- If you see a connection error, ensure Neo4j is running and accessible at the configured URI. The graph must be built before running this command.
