## generate-sim-doc

The `generate-sim-doc` command uses the Azure OpenAI LLM to generate a simulated customer profile for your Azure tenant. The `--size` flag controls the number of simulated users/resources. The output is written to a Markdown file in the `simdocs/` directory.

```bash
uv run azure-tenant-grapher generate-sim-doc --size 1
```

**Output:**
```text

**Troubleshooting:**
- If you see an error, check that your Azure OpenAI environment variables are set and valid. The command requires network access to the Azure OpenAI endpoint.
