## visualize

The `visualize` command generates a 3D HTML visualization of your Azure graph from Neo4j data. This is useful for exploring relationships and resource topology visually. The `--no-container` flag disables auto-starting Neo4j, so you must ensure the database is running.

```bash
uv run azure-tenant-grapher visualize --no-container
```

Action: Ensure Neo4j is running and accessible at the configured URI.
If using Docker, check that the container is started and healthy.
You can start the container with 'python scripts/cli.py container' or 'docker-compose up'.
‚ùå Neo4j is not running and --no-container was specified.
Action: Start Neo4j manually or remove --no-container to let the CLI manage it.
```

**Troubleshooting:**
- If you see a connection error, ensure Neo4j is running and accessible at the configured URI. Use Docker or your preferred method to start the database.
